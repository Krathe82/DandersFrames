-- Canonical row heights (the "airier" scale). A fixed-height widget factory stamps its own slot
-- height onto the widget (widget.preferredHeight + widget.fixedRowHeight), so the layout uses THAT
-- and a call-site number can't make the same widget type render at a different height on a different
-- page. New callers can omit the height entirely; legacy call-site numbers on fixed widgets are
-- ignored (harmless, strippable later). Variable widgets (labels, headers, spacers) are NOT stamped
-- and keep whatever height they are given. One place to retune the whole GUI's vertical rhythm.
-- THE vertical rhythm of the whole GUI.
--
-- These are SLOT heights, not gaps -- LayoutChildren stacks rows flush
-- (y = y - height), so the gap the eye sees between two rows is:
--
--     (slot - content) of the row above  +  (content's top inset) of the row below
--
-- which means a row whose content is short inside a tall slot silently gets a big
-- gap. That is how the GUI ended up with a 4x spread. /df debug gapcheck measured it
-- across four pages (267 rows), and the content heights came back IDENTICAL on
-- every page, so the slots can be derived rather than guessed:
--
--     kind          content   old slot   old gap      new slot   new gap
--     slider          32.0       55        23.0          46        14
--     dropdown        39.8       55        15.2          54        14
--     editbox         39.0       55        16.0          53        14
--     colorpicker     23.9       30         6.1          38        14
--     checkbox        18.2       30        11.8*         35        14*

--
-- So: ONE gap, and every slot is content + RowGap. 14 is not arbitrary -- it is
-- what the dropdown rows already had (15.2), the one spacing Krathe confirmed
-- reads correctly. Sliders lose 9px of slack, colour pickers gain 8.
--
-- * the checkbox's content sits 2.9px below its slot top, so a row landing ON a
--   checkbox reads 14 + 2.9. Zeroing that would mean re-anchoring the checkbox
--   art itself, which moves the tick 3px for 3px -- not worth it.
--
-- A header keeps its 11.1px top inset, so the gap ABOVE a header is 14 + 11.1.
-- That is deliberate: a section title wants air above it and to sit close to
-- what it labels.
GUI.RowGap = 14

-- ...with ONE exception: a RUN of the same COMPACT row type closes up.
--
-- A uniform gap everywhere is right between DIFFERENT kinds -- that is the
-- boundary the eye uses to tell one control apart from the next. But eight
-- checkboxes in a column are one list, not eight things, and 14 between each of
-- them reads as a stack of unrelated rows. So consecutive rows of the same
-- compact kind get RowGapTight, and the first row of a different kind after them
-- gets the full RowGap back. Same spacing between TYPES, tighter within a type.
--
-- Compact means the label sits INLINE with the control (a checkbox's text is
-- beside its tick). Slider, dropdown and edit box are deliberately NOT compact:
-- their label sits ABOVE the control, so tightening the gap there would push the
-- next row's label into the control above it -- the same reasoning already
-- recorded on labelPad, and the reason a stack of sliders needs real air even
-- though a stack of checkboxes does not.

-- ⚠ THERE IS NO RUNTIME GEOMETRY CORRECTION, AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE.
--
-- This GUI used to carry a registry that nudged every bordered box onto the
-- pixel grid after the layout had placed it. It is gone, and the reason is
-- structural rather than a bug in the implementation: Lua-side snapping can only
-- correct a frame at REST, and the symptom it was chasing -- a thin border going
-- soft -- is at its worst while the content is MOVING, during a scroll.
-- Correcting mid-scroll does not fix that, it adds a half-pixel jump on top of
-- it, which reads as flicker. It also cost us the button-row drift, where an
-- unordered sweep corrected chained anchors in a different order each pass.
--
-- Three things replaced it, and between them they are enough:
--   * the LAYOUT picks whole-pixel numbers in the first place (SnapLen below, at
--     the point an offset, width or height is chosen). No runtime cost, nothing
--     to drift, nothing to flicker -- it just picks better numbers.

--
--   (a) sub-pixel  -- the box's top edge lands between two device rows, so the
--                     1px line is filtered across both at half intensity;
--   (b) clipping   -- the box's top edge sits within a pixel of the ScrollFrame's
--                     own clip boundary, so the line is simply cut off.
--
-- Scrolling "fixes" both, which is exactly why the screenshot can't separate
-- them. This reports the numbers for the open page so the next change is aimed.

-- /df debug gapcheck -- measure the vertical rhythm, don't eyeball it
--
-- The question this answers: "which rows are too far apart, and which are too
-- close?" It cannot be answered from GUI.RowHeight alone, because those numbers
-- are SLOT heights, not gaps. LayoutChildren stacks rows flush (y = y - height),
-- so the visible gap between two rows is:
--
--     (slot height - content bottom) of the row above
--   + (slot top - content top)      of the row below
--
-- A row whose content is short inside a tall slot gets a big gap and nothing
-- flags it. The slider is the worst case by construction: it shares the 55 slot
-- with the dropdown and edit box, whose openers reach ~40, while a slider only
-- draws to ~32 (label, an 8px track, a 20px value box) -- so it carries ~23px of
-- slack against their ~15.
--
-- Measured, not derived, for a reason: labels WRAP, override markers hang off
-- rows, banners re-measure themselves after construction, and hideOn rows drop
-- out. Only the live rects know the real content extent, which is exactly the
-- lesson from the border bug -- the arithmetic looked right there too.
--
-- Rows are compared only against their SIBLINGS IN THE SAME GROUP. That is where
-- the rhythm actually reads, and it sidesteps having to reconstruct which column
-- a widget landed in.

-- (Removed) GUI.GapCheckAll — a no-arg alias for GapCheck("all"), superseded once the
-- dispatcher started forwarding the mode argument. Zero callers.

-- Every frame that carries a 1px backdrop edge, so the sweep below can find them
-- without any page needing to know what it contains. Weak keys: a retired page's
-- widgets are reparented to the trash frame rather than destroyed, and this must
-- not be what keeps them reachable.

-- Re-derive the BORDER THICKNESS of everything currently on screen. Since the
-- geometry correction was removed this no longer moves or resizes anything, so
-- the only thing it can change is how many device pixels an edge is drawn at --
-- which only matters when the SCALE changes. That is why its callers are the
-- scale slider and the window drag/resize handlers, not anything per-frame.
--
-- IsVisible (not IsShown) keeps it cheap: a widget on a page that is not open
-- has a hidden ancestor and is skipped, so the work stays proportional to what
-- is displayed rather than to everything the registry has accumulated. Safe to
-- call repeatedly -- it writes only when the computed edge width actually
-- differs, so a second call in the same state does nothing at all.

-- ============================================================
-- PIXEL BORDER -- how every outlined GUI surface draws its edge.
--
-- Four textures we own, instead of a backdrop's edgeFile, because a backdrop
-- edge is drawn one UI unit wide and we cannot control how that lands on the
-- physical pixel grid. At the scales people play at, one unit is about one
-- device pixel, and a one-device-pixel line has exactly two states: [1.0, 0]
-- when it lands on the grid and [0.5, 0.5] when it does not. Identical ink,
-- completely different appearance -- so an edge that crosses the grid while the
-- page scrolls appears to flicker, and at the low alphas this GUI uses, both
-- halves of the split can fall under the visibility floor and the border simply
-- is not there.
--
-- The long way round to this was trying to place that 1px line perfectly. It
-- cannot be done. Lua-side snapping runs at discrete moments -- build,
-- scroll-settle, show -- but the line crosses the grid on EVERY frame of a
-- scroll: correcting at moment N does nothing for the next thirty frames, and
-- correcting mid-motion adds a visible jump on top of the softness. Handing it
-- to the renderer (SetSnapToPixelGrid) is worse still: it rounds the two edges
-- of a thin texture independently, so a 1px line can round to zero height and
-- vanish outright.
--
-- The answer is to stop placing a thin line accurately and draw one that does
-- not care where it lands. See PX_BORDER_THICKNESS below.
local pixelBordered = setmetatable({}, { __mode = "k" })
local PX_SIDES = { "top", "bottom", "left", "right" }

-- THE dial. Border thickness in DEVICE PIXELS, before any per-surface weight.
--
-- The floor is what matters, not the exact value: anything above 1 always covers
-- at least one FULL pixel row plus a partial, so the line can never vanish and
-- never changes its total ink as the content moves. Only 1.0 has the two-state
-- failure ([1.0, 0] when it lands on the grid, [0.5, 0.5] when it does not --
-- identical ink, completely different appearance), which is the flicker that
-- started this.
--
-- Back to 2, and the alpha carries the weight instead. THICKNESS and WEIGHT are
-- separate dials and conflating them was the mistake:
--
--   * thickness decides how UNIFORM the line looks. At 1.5 the rows come out
--     [0.25, 1.0, 0.25] or [0.5, 1.0] depending on where the box lands, so
--     neighbouring boxes render visibly different widths -- Krathe's "one
--     thinner, one thicker". The bigger the base, the smaller that proportion,
--     so 2 is noticeably more even than 1.5.
--   * alpha decides how HEAVY it looks, and does not vary with position at all.
--
-- So: hold thickness at the value that renders evenly, and take the weight out
-- of the alpha. 2px at 0.7 alpha is about the same total ink as 1.5px at full,
-- but without the width wobble.
--
-- The floor still matters if this is ever tuned down: anything above 1 always
-- covers a full row plus a partial, so it cannot vanish. Only 1.0 has the
-- two-state failure -- [1.0, 0] on the grid, [0.5, 0.5] off it, identical ink
-- and completely different appearance -- which was the original flicker.
local PX_BORDER_THICKNESS = 2

-- Applied to every pixel border's alpha. The authored colours were all chosen

local PX_BORDER_ALPHA = 0.7

    -- positions (Y carries the scroll's fractional phase). The old backdrop edge
    -- did it too, so this is not specific to either mechanism.

    -- roughly 0.5 / 1.0 / 0.5 -- for ANY offset. The total ink is constant and
    -- there is always at least one fully-lit row, so the line can neither vanish
    -- nor visibly change weight as the page scrolls. A 1px line has only the two
    -- states [1.0, 0] and [0.5, 0.5]: same ink, completely different appearance,

-- CreateInfoBanner
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- A self-resizing banner with an icon, body text, and a "tone"
-- (info / caution / danger / success) that controls background,
-- border, default text colour, and default icon. ("warning" is a
-- legacy alias of "caution".) Do NOT pass fontTemplate — banners
-- share one font on purpose; only the tone should vary.
--
-- Usage:
--   local banner = GUI:CreateInfoBanner(parent, { tone = "caution", text = "..." })
--   Add(banner, banner.layoutHeight, "both")
--
-- Methods on the returned frame:
--   :SetTone(name)                  apply a preset (see TONES below)
--   :SetText(text, optColor)        plain text mode, auto-wraps + auto-resizes
--   :SetHTML(html, onLinkClick)     flow-layout body with clickable link buttons
--   :SetIcon(texture, r, g, b)      icon texture + optional vertex colour
--   :SetIconTexture(path)           icon texture only
--   :SetIconColor(r, g, b)          icon vertex colour only
--
-- The body word-wraps automatically; banner height is recomputed via
-- OnSizeChanged so resizing the GUI (or calling SetText/SetHTML) grows
-- or shrinks the banner to fit. The host page is re-laid out so widgets
-- below the banner reposition.
-- ============================================================
-- Each tone carries FOUR colour roles so all three consumers (banners,
-- inline ToneHex text, and tooltips) stay in sync:
--   bg / border / textColor / icon+iconColor  drive the BANNER box itself.
--   accent                                     is the vivid emphasis colour
--     used for INLINE text (ToneHex) and tooltip titles, read against the
--     dark GUI background rather than the banner's own tinted bg. It is a
--     SEPARATE role from iconColor: e.g. the danger icon is a light warm so
--     the triangle pops on the orange banner, but inline "Warning" text must
--     be a real red to out-rank a caution — deriving one from the other
--     (the original bug) made inline danger paler than caution.

-- GUI:CreateLink — lean inline text + clickable links in a NOTE style (no box), FIXED layout.
-- The link-capable counterpart to CreateNote: same |cCOLOR|Hdata|hText|h|r markup as the
-- InfoBanner (shared ParseHTMLSegments), rendered as flowing dim body text with a themed,
-- hover-lightening Button per link — but WITHOUT the banner's self-resize machinery, so it is
-- safe inside the Aura Designer's reflowing indicator cards (no OnSizeChanged -> relayout loop
-- that drops FPS there). Only the link words are clickable/hovered (fixes the old note's
-- whole-frame click). Named CreateLink (not CreateLinkText) so we can grow other link forms.
--
-- opts:
--   onLinkClick(data)  called with the link's raw data string on click.
--   width              wrap width; if given, flows immediately. Omit to flow once when the host
--                      first sizes the frame (then it stops — no re-flow loop).
--   fontTemplate       body font (default DFFontHighlightSmall — the note look).
--   lineHeight         per-line height (default 14).
--   padTop/padBottom   vertical breathing room baked into layoutHeight (default 2 / 8) so a note
--                      isn't glued to the controls above/below it — the measured height (and thus
--                      the slot a caller gives it) already includes it. More below than above so
--                      the note reads as annotating the control above while clearing the next one.
-- Returns the frame; frame.layoutHeight is the measured height after flow; frame:Reflow(w)

-- GUI TOOLTIP  (settings-UI tooltips only — NOT unit-frame/aura tooltips)
-- Single source for our own widget tooltips. Call from OnEnter — use HookScript
-- on StyleButton'd widgets so it composes with the hover wash; SetScript on
-- plain frames. Pair with OnLeave -> GUI:HideTooltip().
--   opts.title  (string)   white by default, or tone-coloured
--   opts.tone   nil | "warning" (gold) | "danger" (red)
--   opts.anchor  default: at the CURSOR, lifted clear of it (see CURSOR_LIFT).
--               Krathe's call, 2026-07-27: a settings tooltip should appear where
--               you are pointing, not pinned to a widget edge whose size you are
--               not thinking about — but sitting ON the cursor buried the control
--               you were reading about, so it is offset upward.
--               ⚠ Do NOT pass one per call site. The whole point of the default
--               living here is that every tooltip in the settings UI behaves the
--               same; a page that sets its own is the disjointedness we just
--               removed. ANCHOR_TOP in particular clamps over the owner near the
--               top of the frame — it was in use 14 times and is now gone.
--   opts.lines  array; each element is one of:
--       "text"                     -> body grey (0.7), wrapped
--       " "                        -> blank spacer
--       { text = , hint = true }   -> dim grey (0.55) action hint, wrapped
--       { text = , accent = true } -> mode/context accent colour, wrapped
--       { text = , color = {r,g,b} } -> explicit colour, wrapped
-- ============================================================
-- The line grammar, shared by ShowTooltip and ShowGameTooltip so a DF line
-- appended under a spell tooltip reads exactly like one under a plain title.

-- ============================================================
-- ATTACHING a tooltip to a settings widget — ONE way, for every factory.
--
-- Three factories used to each have their own idea, and on one page the same
-- gesture did three different things:
--     checkbox   .tooltip       hover the container   ANCHOR_CURSOR
--     dropdown   .tooltip       hover the BUTTON      ANCHOR_CURSOR
--     slider     .tooltipText   hover the SLIDER      ANCHOR_RIGHT
-- Worse, on a dropdown and a slider the LABEL sits above the control, outside
-- its hit rect, so hovering the words never did anything — while on a checkbox
-- (label beside the box, inside the container) it did. Five more factories —
-- colour picker, font / texture dropdown, input, growth control — had no
-- tooltip support at all, so ~136 controls could not carry one.
--
-- The rule now: THE HIT AREA IS THE LABEL, and only the label.
--
-- ⚠ This is deliberately NOT the whole widget. The first version of this hovered
-- the control too, which is the obvious reading of "make the label work" — but a
-- cursor-anchored tooltip then sits on top of the slider or dropdown you are
-- trying to read and operate, and no amount of offsetting it fully solves that,
-- because the thing you point at IS the thing being covered. Krathe's call,
-- 2026-07-27, after trying both. Reading and adjusting are separate gestures:
-- point at the words to find out what it does, point at the control to use it.
--
-- The label is a FontString and cannot take mouse input, so each widget gets one
-- invisible frame sized to the label's own rect. That also handles a label wider
-- than its container for free (the checkbox case) — the frame follows the TEXT,
-- not the box, so there is no hit-rect arithmetic to keep in sync.
--
-- The anchor is whatever ShowTooltip defaults to — set in ONE place so no page
-- can drift. Nothing here passes an anchor, deliberately.
--
-- The spec is read AT HOVER TIME, not when it is attached — every call site
-- sets it after creation, on the container the factory returned:
--     widget.tooltip = "body"                  title = the widget's own label
--     widget.tooltip = { title=, lines=, tone= }   the full ShowTooltip shape

-- A bare checkbox sized for a LIST ROW — no label, no db binding, no settings-row
-- geometry. GUI:CreateCheckbox is a whole 30px settings row with its own label and
-- hit rect, which is the wrong shape entirely inside a 22px pooled list row that
-- already owns its own text, count and selection accent.
--
-- The caller drives it: :SetChecked(bool) to paint, opts.onClick to react. It does
-- NOT read or write the db itself, because a list row's meaning changes per bind
-- (a pooled row is a different filter every refresh) and a captured dbKey would go
-- stale the moment the pool rebinds.
--
-- ⚠ Clicks deliberately do NOT propagate. The override marker above lets them fall
-- through because it is a passive marker; this is a control, and on a clickable row
-- the two gestures must stay separate — tick the box to switch the filter on, click
-- anywhere else to select it. Nothing here calls SetPropagateMouseClicks, which is
-- PROTECTED on 12.1 anyway (see the note in CreateOverrideMarker).
--
-- ⚠ The BOX ITSELF is GUI:StyleCheckButton, the addon's one checkbox look — do not
-- hand-roll it again. This was hand-rolled once and drifted four ways: it drew the
-- Media\Icons\check GLYPH where every other checkbox in the addon draws a filled
-- WHITE8x8 square (a different SYMBOL, not a different style), it skipped PixelUtil
-- so it alone was unsnapped, it had no hover wash, and it recoloured its BORDER when
-- checked, which nothing else does. CreateDebugCategoryRow is the precedent for this
-- exact case — a list row with a checkbox — at the same size.
--
-- manualCheck because this is a plain Button, not a CheckButton: SetChecked below
-- drives the mark. A real CheckButton would draw its checked mark through the native
-- checked state, which has no disabled-checked texture here — so a greyed-but-ticked
-- row (every filter row while All Buffs is on) would lose its tick entirely.

-- A wide row with checkbox + bold category name + description.
-- The whole row is clickable, hover shows a background highlight,
-- and the description is also surfaced as a tooltip on hover so it
-- remains accessible even if it gets visually truncated.
--
-- Used by the Debug > Categories sub-tab. The categoryKey writes
-- directly to DandersFramesDB_v2.debug.filters.
-- ============================================================
-- opts.noisy marks a firehose category: one user action can produce dozens of
-- lines, which evicts the trace the log was opened to capture. It renders as the
-- shared caution icon with its own tooltip rather than a "(noisy)" suffix baked
-- into the description string -- the suffix was untranslatable in place, and it
-- competed with the description for the same line of text.

-- customGet / customSet (optional, matches CreateDropdown's pattern): when

-- lives inside a nested table (e.g. Border Alpha → <prefix>BorderColor.a),
-- where the plain `dbTable[dbKey] = v` path can't express the nesting.
-- Consumers that pass customSet typically pass dbKey = nil so the
-- auto-profile override system doesn't track a key that doesn't exist at the
-- top level of dbTable.
-- accentColor (optional {r,g,b}): fixed thumb/fill colour instead of the mode
-- theme — for ClickCasting (green) / Search (blue) which keep their identity.

-- UNIFIED BORDER CONTROL SET
-- Drops the canonical Show / Style / Texture / Size / Colour controls plus
-- whichever optional Phase B controls the consumer opts into (offset, inset,
-- blendMode, gradient, shadow). Saved-variable keys are built from a single
-- camelCase `prefix` (e.g. "defensiveIcon" → "defensiveIconBorderSize"), so
-- consumers add one call instead of hand-rolling ~6-15 widgets each.
--
-- Each opts.include flag is per-element: "tailor-made to what makes logical
-- sense" — the API exposes everything, but consumers opt in only to what fits
-- their element. Returns a table of widget references so the caller can add
-- per-element extras (dispel-type colour, pulsate, etc.) afterwards.
--
-- opts = {
--   parent       = the panel widget (e.g. self.child) — same first arg the
--                  underlying CreateCheckbox/Slider/etc. take
--   include      = { offset=, inset=, blendMode=, gradient=, shadow=,
--                    classColor=, roleColor=, colorByTime=, colorByType= }
--   fullUpdate   = callback for full re-render (drop / value-set)
--   lightUpdate  = callback for slider-drag (size, offsets, shadow sliders)

--   disableWhen  = optional predicate fn(db) → bool. When true, EVERY widget
--                  (including the Show toggle itself) GREYS OUT in place. This
--                  is what a consumer whose border sits under a feature toggle
--                  wants — the addon-wide rule is that a deactivated control
--                  greys where it is, so the page doesn't reflow and you can
--                  still see what turning the feature on would give you.
--   hideWhen     = optional predicate fn(db) → bool. When true, EVERY widget
--                  (including the Show toggle itself) HIDES. Reserve this for a
--                  gate that changes WHAT the page offers — a variant switch
--                  like Pinned Frames' per-set border override, where the
--                  controls belong to a mode you are not in. A plain on/off

-- EXPIRATION CONTROLS (shared) — the 12.1-safe Expiration panel. Pairs with the
-- DF.Expiration engine (Features/Expiration.lua): the engine turns the expiryAlert* keys
-- into a secret-safe reveal, this builds the UI for them, so every consumer (AD icon/square
-- now; frame-level indicators later) renders the same flow with no hand-rolled copy.
--
-- Flow: a master Enable toggle, then Threshold, then a Type dropdown (Border / Tint / Text /
-- Glyph — no Off; Enable owns on/off), then the Type-specific controls.
--
-- HIDE-vs-GREY policy (the rework rule): a control that does NOT belong to the current Type is
-- HIDDEN (its row collapses via hideOn + the group's LayoutChildren + the caller's reflow); a
-- control that belongs but is momentarily inactive is GREYED via disableOn / the group's
-- disableChildrenOn (the standard grey-out). So:
--   Enable off -> everything below the toggle GREYS (stays visible to preview), like
--                 CreateBorderControls' "Show Border off => grey".
--   TEXT/GLYPH -> the text box / glyph dropdown + Anchor (plus Threshold/Offsets/Size).
--   BORDER     -> Match, Colour Mode, Colour (GREY under By-Time), Style, Inset, Opacity
--                 (plus Threshold/Offsets/Size — Size GREYS under Match). No Anchor (centres).
--   TINT       -> as BORDER but no Style (a wash has no thickness).
--
-- Keys are the fixed expiryAlert* set on the passed dbTable (the AD per-aura proxy, or any
-- consumer's table) — every consumer stores the same keys, so no key map is needed. hideOn/
-- disableOn predicates read dbTable directly (ignoring the arg LayoutChildren/RefreshChildStates
-- pass, which is DF.db[SelectedMode]) — the CreateBorderControls convention, and the only way
-- a per-aura proxy's state is seen.
--
-- opts:
--   parent         REQUIRED — the card/page scroll child (widgets parent to it).
--   fullUpdate     value-change callback (re-render preview + live frames).
--   refreshStates  relayout callback — MUST re-run hideOn (LayoutChildren), disableOn
--                  (RefreshChildStates) and the sibling reflow so a mode change collapses the
--                  now-irrelevant rows and slides neighbours. The mode / match / colour-mode
--                  controls fire it. Called once by the caller after build for the initial state.
--   include        { text, glyph, border, tint } — default all true; a consumer can drop modes.
