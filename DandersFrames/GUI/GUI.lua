-- Canonical row heights (the "airier" scale). A fixed-height widget factory stamps its own slot
-- height onto the widget (widget.preferredHeight + widget.fixedRowHeight), so the layout uses THAT
-- and a call-site number can't make the same widget type render at a different height on a different
-- page. New callers can omit the height entirely; legacy call-site numbers on fixed widgets are
-- ignored (harmless, strippable later). Variable widgets (labels, headers, spacers) are NOT stamped
-- and keep whatever height they are given. One place to retune the whole GUI's vertical rhythm.
-- THE vertical rhythm of the whole GUI.
--
-- These are SLOT heights, not gaps -- LayoutChildren stacks rows flush
-- (y = y - height), so the gap the eye sees between two rows is:
--
--     (slot - content) of the row above  +  (content's top inset) of the row below
--
-- which means a row whose content is short inside a tall slot silently gets a big
-- gap. That is how the GUI ended up with a 4x spread. /df debug gapcheck measured it
-- across four pages (267 rows), and the content heights came back IDENTICAL on
-- every page, so the slots can be derived rather than guessed:
--
--     kind          content   old slot   old gap      new slot   new gap

--
-- * the checkbox's content sits 2.9px below its slot top, so a row landing ON a
--   checkbox reads 14 + 2.9. Zeroing that would mean re-anchoring the checkbox
--   art itself, which moves the tick 3px for 3px -- not worth it.
--
-- A header keeps its 11.1px top inset, so the gap ABOVE a header is 14 + 11.1.
-- That is deliberate: a section title wants air above it and to sit close to
-- what it labels.

-- compact kind get RowGapTight, and the first row of a different kind after them
-- gets the full RowGap back. Same spacing between TYPES, tighter within a type.
--
-- Compact means the label sits INLINE with the control (a checkbox's text is
-- beside its tick). Slider, dropdown and edit box are deliberately NOT compact:
-- their label sits ABOVE the control, so tightening the gap there would push the
-- next row's label into the control above it -- the same reasoning already

-- ⚠ THERE IS NO RUNTIME GEOMETRY CORRECTION, AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE.
--
-- This GUI used to carry a registry that nudged every bordered box onto the
-- pixel grid after the layout had placed it. It is gone, and the reason is
-- structural rather than a bug in the implementation: Lua-side snapping can only
-- correct a frame at REST, and the symptom it was chasing -- a thin border going
-- soft -- is at its worst while the content is MOVING, during a scroll.
-- Correcting mid-scroll does not fix that, it adds a half-pixel jump on top of
-- it, which reads as flicker. It also cost us the button-row drift, where an
-- unordered sweep corrected chained anchors in a different order each pass.
--
-- Three things replaced it, and between them they are enough:
--   * the LAYOUT picks whole-pixel numbers in the first place (SnapLen below, at
--     the point an offset, width or height is chosen). No runtime cost, nothing
--     to drift, nothing to flicker -- it just picks better numbers.
--   * the CLIP SURFACES are snapped (page viewport insets, the content panel,
--     the nav chain). Those were real bugs: a box clipped by a fractional edge
--     loses part of its border no matter how well the box itself is placed.
--   * the BORDER is drawn as two device pixels of our own texture rather than a
--     one-unit backdrop edge, so it cannot land badly in the first place. See
--     PIXEL BORDER further down -- that is the part that actually solved it.

-- Round a LENGTH or OFFSET (in UI units) to a whole number of device pixels at
-- the scale `frame` is drawn at. This is the layout-side half of the pixel-grid
-- work, and the half that was missing.
--
-- A box lands on the grid only if the numbers it was GIVEN were whole pixels.
-- They usually are not: a group's inner width is (its width - 2 * padding), and
-- its padding is 10 UI units, which is a whole number of device pixels only when
-- the GUI is at exactly 1:1 scale. Everywhere else the box's right and bottom
-- edges fall mid-pixel, and anything clipped by them loses part of itself.

-- anything the box itself measures. The one thing that tracked the symptom was

-- /df debug navprobe -- catch the left-nav hover flash in the act
--
-- The symptom: sweeping the cursor down the nav list shows a "ghost" -- of the
-- row's text, or of the bottom part of the hover plate. It happens at moderate
-- speed, not just fast, and it survived snapping the row geometry.
--
-- Four causes would produce that, and they are INDISTINGUISHABLE in a
-- screenshot, which is why this measures instead of reasoning:
--
--   (a) two rows lit at once -- the previous row's OnLeave never ran, so two
--       plates are visible together for a frame or two;
--   (b) focus thrash -- the cursor sits still over one row but mouse focus
--       alternates between it and something else (the scroll frame, a sibling,
--       an overlapping rect), so the plate flickers on and off in place;
--   (c) geometry -- rows overlap, or leave a dead band between them where
--       NOTHING is lit, so crossing it reads as the plate breaking up;
--   (d) none of the above -- a pure rendering artefact, in which case the trace
--       shows exactly one clean enter/leave per row and the answer is elsewhere.
--
-- Static geometry first (overlaps and dead bands are visible without moving the
-- mouse), then a live trace of every change in focus and in each row's plate
-- alpha, stamped with the frame number. (a) and (b) show up as repeated
-- transitions within a single crossing; (c) as a run of frames with nothing lit.

--
-- The question this answers: "which rows are too far apart, and which are too
-- close?" It cannot be answered from GUI.RowHeight alone, because those numbers
-- are SLOT heights, not gaps. LayoutChildren stacks rows flush (y = y - height),
-- so the visible gap between two rows is:
--
--     (slot height - content bottom) of the row above
--   + (slot top - content top)      of the row below
--
-- A row whose content is short inside a tall slot gets a big gap and nothing
-- flags it. The slider is the worst case by construction: it shares the 55 slot
-- with the dropdown and edit box, whose openers reach ~40, while a slider only
-- draws to ~32 (label, an 8px track, a 20px value box) -- so it carries ~23px of
-- slack against their ~15.
--
-- Measured, not derived, for a reason: labels WRAP, override markers hang off
-- rows, banners re-measure themselves after construction, and hideOn rows drop
-- out. Only the live rects know the real content extent, which is exactly the
-- lesson from the border bug -- the arithmetic looked right there too.

-- (Removed) GUI.GapCheckAll — a no-arg alias for GapCheck("all"), superseded once the

-- Every frame that carries a 1px backdrop edge, so the sweep below can find them
-- without any page needing to know what it contains. Weak keys: a retired page's
-- widgets are reparented to the trash frame rather than destroyed, and this must
-- not be what keeps them reachable.

-- Re-derive the BORDER THICKNESS of everything currently on screen. Since the
-- geometry correction was removed this no longer moves or resizes anything, so
-- the only thing it can change is how many device pixels an edge is drawn at --
-- which only matters when the SCALE changes. That is why its callers are the
-- scale slider and the window drag/resize handlers, not anything per-frame.
--
-- IsVisible (not IsShown) keeps it cheap: a widget on a page that is not open
-- has a hidden ancestor and is skipped, so the work stays proportional to what
-- is displayed rather than to everything the registry has accumulated. Safe to
-- call repeatedly -- it writes only when the computed edge width actually
-- differs, so a second call in the same state does nothing at all.

-- ============================================================
-- PIXEL BORDER -- how every outlined GUI surface draws its edge.
--
-- Four textures we own, instead of a backdrop's edgeFile, because a backdrop
-- edge is drawn one UI unit wide and we cannot control how that lands on the
-- physical pixel grid. At the scales people play at, one unit is about one
-- device pixel, and a one-device-pixel line has exactly two states: [1.0, 0]
-- when it lands on the grid and [0.5, 0.5] when it does not. Identical ink,
-- completely different appearance -- so an edge that crosses the grid while the
-- page scrolls appears to flicker, and at the low alphas this GUI uses, both
-- halves of the split can fall under the visibility floor and the border simply
-- is not there.
--
-- The long way round to this was trying to place that 1px line perfectly. It
-- cannot be done. Lua-side snapping runs at discrete moments -- build,
-- scroll-settle, show -- but the line crosses the grid on EVERY frame of a
-- scroll: correcting at moment N does nothing for the next thirty frames, and
-- correcting mid-motion adds a visible jump on top of the softness. Handing it
-- to the renderer (SetSnapToPixelGrid) is worse still: it rounds the two edges
-- of a thin texture independently, so a 1px line can round to zero height and
-- vanish outright.
--
-- The answer is to stop placing a thin line accurately and draw one that does
-- not care where it lands. See PX_BORDER_THICKNESS below.
local pixelBordered = setmetatable({}, { __mode = "k" })
local PX_SIDES = { "top", "bottom", "left", "right" }

-- THE dial. Border thickness in DEVICE PIXELS, before any per-surface weight.
--
-- The floor is what matters, not the exact value: anything above 1 always covers
-- at least one FULL pixel row plus a partial, so the line can never vanish and
-- never changes its total ink as the content moves. Only 1.0 has the two-state
-- failure ([1.0, 0] when it lands on the grid, [0.5, 0.5] when it does not --
-- identical ink, completely different appearance), which is the flicker that
-- started this.
--
-- Back to 2, and the alpha carries the weight instead. THICKNESS and WEIGHT are
-- separate dials and conflating them was the mistake:
--
--   * thickness decides how UNIFORM the line looks. At 1.5 the rows come out
--     [0.25, 1.0, 0.25] or [0.5, 1.0] depending on where the box lands, so
--     neighbouring boxes render visibly different widths -- Krathe's "one
--     thinner, one thicker". The bigger the base, the smaller that proportion,
--     so 2 is noticeably more even than 1.5.
--   * alpha decides how HEAVY it looks, and does not vary with position at all.

-- nothing to see in a log.
--
-- So the frame gets its own method that shadows the mixin's. Every existing
-- caller keeps working unchanged, and there is no list to be exhaustive about.
