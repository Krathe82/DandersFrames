-- DEFERRED WORK QUEUE
-- ============================================================
-- Click casting cannot touch secure state in combat, so work blocked by
-- combat lockdown has to be replayed afterwards. This used to be ten
-- separate self.needsX / self.pendingX flags, each with its own set-site and
-- its own hand-written drain line in OnCombatEnd. Adding a deferral meant
-- remembering to add a matching drain; forgetting silently dropped the work
-- for the rest of the session (that is how the arena cold-start bug and the
-- keyboard-refresh drop both happened).
--
-- Now there is one queue. Register the job here, call CC:Defer("job"), and
-- the drain is automatic and ordered. Three job kinds:
--   flag  - "do this thing later", no payload, dedupes to a single run
--   value - carries one value (a profile name, a repair reason); policy
--           "first" keeps the earliest, "last" keeps the most recent
--   set   - accumulates a set of items (frames) and runs once over all
--
-- A job's run() returns true to request a UI refresh once the drain settles.
-- DRAIN_ORDER is load-bearing: it reproduces the exact sequence the old
-- OnCombatEnd used. Do not reorder without checking that dependency chain
-- (profile switch must precede binding work; registration must precede the
-- binding refresh that walks registered frames).

-- must go through this guard: with the panel never opened the method is nil,
-- and DeferAfter runs its callback raw inside a C_Timer, so an unguarded call
-- is a Lua error on every talent swap. A refresh with no UI is correctly a
-- no-op -- the panel builds itself from current state when it loads.
