    -- anything but a short window.
    --
    -- Measured from GUI.contentFrame, which is anchored to the window's edges and
    -- is therefore the real viewport. CHROME is everything this page stacks above
    -- and below the panels: top pad + banner + gap, and below, the spell-database
    -- freshness label and the bottom pad. It matches the spacer's own arithmetic

    -- its own bottom padding to the content height — and the main window grows a
    -- scrollbar for a few pixels of overflow. The slack absorbs that without
    -- needing to know the layout's padding, which is not this page's business.

    -- 240 until the right-hand header stopped needing so much room: the search box
    -- and the Add-from-Database button used to share one row and fight for width, so
    -- the right column was sized around the worst case. They are on separate rows

    --   rest  = the BACKGROUND tone at 0.6, which lands UNDER the panel it sits on,

    --           text — it was never the problem and must not be flattened.
    --   hover = C_HOVER, the value the main nav uses, well clear of the panel.

    -- their rest border is C_BORDER at HALF alpha, which over a hovered row
    -- composites to ~0.235: a 0.015 difference, so a button dissolves into the
    -- highlight it is sitting on. At rest the row is ~0.10 and the same button
    -- is 0.084 clear, which is why they only merge on hover.
    --
    -- Only row.remove needs it now: the row's click does not fire that button, so it
    -- just gets its border brightened enough to stay legible. Priming a destructive
    -- "x" the row will NOT trigger would be worse than the merge.
    --
    -- row.check is deliberately not wired in: its checked mark is accent-coloured, so
    -- it separates from the wash by HUE rather than by a few percent of grey, and it
    -- takes no mouse of its own. (The membership BUTTON that used to live here did
    -- need the full SetHovered treatment -- it is gone, and so is that branch.)

    -- This does not move the row's own colour, which the main nav shares. The
    -- button's own OnEnter/OnLeave still owns its look while the mouse is on it;
    -- leaving a child re-enters the row, so the row's OnEnter re-applies after.
    --
    -- Left-hand filter rows carry no chromed controls (a label, a count and the
    -- override dot), so they are deliberately not wired to this.
    -- Derived, not picked by eye: at rest the border reads ~0.235 on a ~0.096 row,
    -- a separation of ~0.14. Holding that same separation above a 0.22 hovered row
    -- wants ~0.36 at full alpha. 0.40 gives a little margin without making the

    -- Naming that flip is what keeps the Hide/Show rows from reading like the
    -- Enable/Disable ones above.
    --
    -- ⚠ The blacklist copy must NOT say debuffs "all show" — the Aura Filters page
    -- carries a debuffFilter selection that already restricts them, so opt-out
    -- describes the MECHANISM here, not the starting state.
    --
    -- Each text also has to carry what you can DO, because the two halves differ:
    -- buff filters are editable and you can add your own, while the blacklist is a
    -- fixed catalog (BlacklistDebuffs) with search, add-by-ID, add-from-database
    -- and Duplicate all hidden or disabled. "This list is fixed" is what answers
    -- the missing add button.
    --
    -- Both texts are ~2 lines, so the swap barely changes the banner height. RefreshRight
    -- drives the swap; SetHTML is idempotent so it only recomputes on a real
    -- buff<->blacklist transition. HTML mode so the buff copy links back to the

    -- genuinely surprising, genuinely destructive fact in this system, and it goes
    -- first.
    --
    -- ⚠ Do not put "switching one on here shows it on the bar" back in. It was the
    -- banner's opening clause and it duplicated the section hint six inches below,
    -- where it belongs -- the hint sits with the ticks it describes and cannot
    -- scroll out of view, and the status line then says it again for the SELECTED
    -- filter. Three statements of one rule and none of the shared-library warning.
    --
    -- One sentence, deliberately. The predecessor of this banner ran to two
    -- paragraphs and six links, and a page needing that much prose to explain itself
    -- is the thing this whole merge was fixing. The old copy also only ever
    -- mentioned buffs, and pointed at a separate Aura Filters page that no longer
    -- exists -- this page IS that page now.
    -- Leads with what this tab lets you DO. The buff half is the one place on the page
    -- where everything is yours to change, which is worth saying outright -- it is the
    -- exact opposite of the Debuffs banner below, whose job is to say that almost
    -- nothing there is.
    --
    -- It no longer opens with "editing a filter changes it everywhere it is used".
    -- That warning has not been dropped so much as moved to where it is accurate: the
    -- STATUS LINE under each filter's name lists that filter's actual consumers, live,
    -- which a fixed sentence cannot do -- whether the Aura Designer uses a given
    -- filter depends on whether you have built a filter group and linked it.
    --
    -- ⚠ "Aura Designer FILTER GROUPS", not "the Aura Designer". A normal AD group
    -- holds `members` -- spells you placed yourself -- and never touches this
    -- registry; only a Filter Group (kind == "filter") carries a filterSelection. An
    -- earlier version named the Aura Designer as a peer of the Defensive Icon, which

    -- is not a state that exists, and a branch for it is dead code. This banner

    -- fixed), and how the one editable thing on the tab works.
