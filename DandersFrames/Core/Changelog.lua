### WoW 12.1 (Midnight) Rework

*The 12.1 rework is a big team effort — brought to you by Danders, Krathe and Maelareth. A single change below often includes work from more than one of us, so entries aren't credited individually.*

DandersFrames has been rebuilt for WoW 12.1 (Midnight), which fundamentally changed how the game handles auras. This build runs on 12.1 only — 12.0.x stays on 4.7. Every aura row — buffs, debuffs, defensives and missing buffs — now renders through the game's new protected aura engine.

* (Auras) **New: Dispel Text.** The debuff bar can show a short letter code on each debuff for its dispel type — Ma for Magic, Po for Poison, and so on — a colourblind-friendly cue alongside the coloured border. It uses the game's own wording for your language. Enable it in the new "Dispel Text" section on the Debuffs page, with font, size, colour and position options. No Accessibility setting is needed: the text shows whether or not Colorblind Mode is on.
* (Auras) New "Aura Duration Update Rate" setting (General > Settings) — choose how often aura countdown text refreshes: Smooth, Normal or Performance. Applies account-wide to the buff, debuff and defensive bars and Aura Designer indicators.
* (Auras) Permanent auras no longer show a duration timer on their icons. This is the new default for the buff, debuff and defensive bars and for Aura Designer indicators and groups — you can bring the timer back with the "Hide Duration on Permanent Auras" checkbox in each Duration section.
* (Auras) **New: Duration Bars.** Buff, debuff and defensive icons can now show a small bar that drains with each aura's remaining time, tucked just below (or above) the icon. Enable it in the new "Duration Bar" section on the Buffs, Debuffs and Defensive Icon pages, with height, gap, texture and colour options — and Aura Designer groups get the same section on each group card.
* (Auras) New sort controls: buff and debuff bars can show your own auras first and reverse the sort direction, and the defensive icon's order is now selectable (Externals First, Most Urgent, or Default).
* (Auras) **Duration text can now show a percentage.** The Duration Format dropdown gains a "Percent" option (shows "45%" instead of the seconds remaining), on the Buffs, Debuffs and Defensive Icon pages and on every Aura Designer indicator. The Aura Designer bar, which has room for a longer label, also gets a "Seconds + Percent" option that shows both at once (like "12s (45%)"). The old "Short" format is now labelled "Seconds", and "Full" (the wordy "14 Seconds" form) is no longer offered for icons where it never fit — it stays available for Aura Designer bars. Colour by Time still applies to the percentage, and "Hide Above" is unavailable while a percent format is selected (its threshold is in seconds).
* (Auras) **New "Order Applied" sort order.** Buffs and debuffs can now be sorted by the order they were applied, so an icon keeps its place for as long as the aura lasts instead of moving each time it refreshes — worth choosing if you track auras by position rather than by reading them. Available on the Buffs and Debuffs pages, and on every Aura Designer group card. "My Auras First" doesn't apply to it (it is one fixed order), so it greys out while it's selected. The Sort Order lists now read Default → Time Remaining → Alphabetical → Order Applied rather than alphabetically.
* (Tooltips) **Aura tooltip position and Disable in Combat work again.** The Tooltips page's Anchor, Offset and "Disable in Combat" controls for buff, debuff and defensive icons were greyed out on 12.1 as a game limitation — the new aura engine wouldn't let an addon place the tooltip. The current build restores that, so those settings drive the tooltip again: pin it to the icon with an offset, follow the cursor, or leave it on the game default, and hide it in combat. Changes apply live (at the end of combat if you're mid-fight). "Center" has no game equivalent and falls back to the default position.
* (Auras) The Dispellable debuff filter has a new "Any Dispel Type" mode — show every debuff with a dispel type, even ones nobody in the group can dispel.
* (Auras) New "Hide Permanent Auras" option for the buff bar — hides buffs with no duration, like auras that last until cancelled.
* (Aura Designer) Groups get sort controls too — each filter, other-buff and debuff group card now has its own Sort Order, "My Auras First" and "Reverse Order" options.
* (Auras) Changing aura filters, sort order, or max icons no longer rebuilds the icon rows — changes apply instantly in place, with no flicker. This covers the buff, debuff and defensive bars and the Aura Designer's filter and debuff groups. Changes made in combat apply the moment combat ends.
* (Aura Designer) **The Aura Designer now works for every spec** — previously healers and Augmentation only. The spec dropdown is grouped by class and searchable.
* (Aura Designer) **New: Filter Groups.** Place an entire filter on the frame as its own icon row — link built-in or custom filters, and every matching buff appears in a self-arranging row with its own position, icon size, growth and icon cap. Aura Filters changes apply to linked groups immediately, and buffs shown by a group leave the buff bar while "Hide Duplicate Buffs" is on.
* (Aura Designer) **New: Expiry Alerts.** Indicators can now warn you when a tracked buff is about to run out — below a threshold you choose, your own custom text or a warning glyph appears on the unit frame, positioned and sized however you like, so a tracked shield can literally say "Shield dropping!". Find it in each indicator's Expiry Warning section.
* (Aura Designer) Open dropdown menus now close when switching tabs instead of lingering over the new tab.
* (Auras) "Hide Long Debuffs" now also works while "All Debuffs" is enabled. "Keep important debuffs" still requires the category filters.
* (Aura Designer) Fix cooldown swipes on indicators and groups draining in the opposite direction from the buff and debuff bars.
* (Aura Designer) Fix error spam from the health bar overlay, most noticeable in follower dungeons and other content where players join and leave often.
* (Interface) Fix spells with hidden tooltips (like Strength of the Black Ox) showing an empty box in the Aura Filters spell list — they now show their name and spell ID.
* (Aura Designer) One spell picker everywhere — adding indicators, group spells and triggers all use the same spell database picker as Aura Filters, with search, class and category filters, and add-by-ID.
* (Aura Designer) Every indicator has a show/hide eye — turn one off without deleting it.
* (Aura Designer) The editor header is condensed to a single row; Sound Alerts moved to the Global tab.
* (Aura Designer) **Sound alerts do more than announce a new buff.** Each indicator's Sound section can now play a separate sound when a tracked buff **drops off** and when it **gains a stack**, alongside the existing on-applied alert (which now has its own on/off toggle). The sound system was also rebuilt on 12.1's new aura-sound engine so alerts keep working on the current build. The buff-dropped and stack-gained triggers need the current game build; the section notes this if your client doesn't have them yet.
* (Profiles) Custom filters and your category tweaks travel with profile exports — including filters linked in the Aura Designer.
* (Profiles) Custom filters picked inside a raid auto layout's settings are handled everywhere the rest of the profile is: deleting a filter now removes it from every layout (including the active one), exports carry filters only a layout references, and imports re-link them instead of pointing at the wrong filter on the receiving account.
* (Aura Filters) **New: share a single filter.** Filters can now be exported and imported one at a time, so you can send someone one filter instead of your whole profile. "+ Import Filter" sits under "+ New Buff Filter" in the list, and Export is in the button strip below it. Built-in presets can be shared too — they arrive as a custom filter holding whatever spells you had enabled. If you import a filter you already have, DandersFrames says so and lets you pick between keeping yours or adding a copy.
* (Frames) The Out of Range "Text Alpha" slider now also governs pet frame text and the test-mode preview — those still followed hidden per-element values no control could change.
* (Interface) In Aura Filters, a spell added by ID now shows its real name and icon (resolved from the game) instead of a bare "#id" and a question mark. It's tagged "not in database" so you can spot spells that aren't part of a built-in preset yet; only a genuinely invalid ID still reads "unknown ID".
* (Interface) Fixed the Aura Filters page's Add, Add from Database, Rename and Delete buttons filling with a solid colour on hover after switching between a built-in preset and a custom filter, and gave their disabled-state tooltips a consistent two-line layout.
* (Frames) DandersFrames no longer overwrites Blizzard's own raid-frame dispel indicator setting at every login — a leftover from a long-removed option that kept forcing a value you couldn't change.
* (Interface) The Aura Filters add-by-ID box now rejects over-long spell IDs like the spell picker does, and a spell picker first opened during combat regains its Escape-to-close afterwards.
* (Profiles) Role colours (tank/healer/damage) now travel with profile exports.
* (Aura Designer) The global Default Frame Level and "Draw above frame border" were marked as not yet available for part of the 12.1 alpha — they looked live but weren't applied. The z-order pass they were waiting on has since landed (below), so they work again. The Frame Strata dropdowns are gone rather than restored — see the same entry.
* (Interface) Removed the Resurrection icon's "Pending Text" box and the "My Buff Indicators" export category — neither had done anything (the text was never rendered; the category exported no settings).
* (Auras) Fixed an error ("Attempt to access forbidden object") from the dispel overlay when zoning out of an instance mid-run — the overlay's layout pass could measure a protected aura-button rect during the transition; it now measures safely and falls back to defaults for that one pass.
* (Bars) Fixed a gap on either side of a "Match Health Bar Width" resource bar at frame border sizes 1-3 (most visible with a non-zero Frame Padding). The bar now sits flush inside the border, and stays aligned with it at any UI scale.
* (Frames) Fixed grouped raid frames staying invisible after converting a raid to a party and back until a /reload — the frames were alive underneath, but their group anchors were never restored on re-entering the raid.
* (Aura Designer) Fixed the editor's preview icons vanishing after switching to another settings page and back — from the second round trip on they stayed missing until the window was reopened or an indicator was toggled.
* (Aura Designer) **Fixed new group names counting up forever.** Creating and deleting groups left the next one called "Group 7" on an empty designer, because the label came from a counter that never reset. New groups are now numbered from the groups that actually exist, so an empty designer starts at Group 1 again (a gap is still left where a group was deleted, so the list stays in order). Applies to Group, Filter Group and Debuff Group names; the internal ids are unchanged, so existing indicator links are unaffected.
* (Frames) **Fixed the Reduced Max Health overlay disappearing in Mythic+ and raids** — exactly where max-HP reductions happen. In restricted content the game returns the modifier as a secret value, and the overlay was hiding rather than touch it; the value can be fed straight to the bar (the same way health bars render at all on 12.1), so it renders again. Health-bar clipping stays off on that path as a safety measure.
* (Auras) **Fixed Pixel Perfect on the new aura engine.** With Pixel Perfect on, aura icon borders could render unevenly — a fat edge one side, a thin or missing edge another, a visible gap between border and icon, and adjacent icons in a row each looking different. Borders now snap to whole screen pixels in their actual rendered space (including scaled icons), icon sizes and spacing quantize to whole pixels so rows stay uniform, and each icon row is nudged onto the pixel grid — restoring what Pixel Perfect delivered before the 12.1 rework, across the buff/debuff/defensive bars, Aura Designer indicators and groups, and missing-buff icons.
* (Profiles) Fixed a doubled "v" (like "vv5.0.0") in the version shown after parsing a profile import string.
* (Auras) Fixed an error storm ("Attempt to access forbidden object") from the dispel overlay's out-of-range fade during combat in restricted content — the fade wrote alpha directly on the game's protected aura buttons; it now dims the overlay through its own wrapper, same result without touching protected objects.
* (Auras) **Fixed random buffs (food, flasks, everything) flooding spell-ID-filtered bars for cross-faction group members.** The game only honours spell-ID aura filters for units you can currently assist — and a cross-faction group member only counts as assistable inside instanced content (dueling a party member does the same). Outside, the filter silently stopped applying and every filtered surface could show wrong buffs on that player — the buff and defensive bars, missing-buff icons, and Aura Designer indicators (including "My Buffs" ones, where a buff you cast in the instance could keep showing in the wrong indicator afterwards). All of these now hide for that unit until they're assistable again, re-checking after loading screens and as member data settles — no more garbage rows for cross-faction friends in the open world.
* (Auras) **Fixed "Only My Buffs" showing other players' buffs on a party member who's in a different instance than you.** The "my buffs" filter needs each aura's caster, which the game can't attribute for a unit outside your instance — so it quietly fell back to showing that buff from *everyone* (the spell-category filters kept working, so it looked like only that one option had broken, and `UnitCanAssist` stayed true so the cross-faction fix above didn't catch it). Those pools now hide for a unit who isn't in your visible world, the same way cross-faction pools do. Same-instance members far out of range are unaffected.
* (Auras) Renamed two built-in filter presets: "Per-spec Healing" is now **Healing**, and "Raid Defensives" is now **Raid Cooldowns**. Your selections and per-spell toggles carry over unchanged.
* (Frames) Clicks on party and raid frames no longer redirect to a member's vehicle or pet slot while the game flags them as being in a vehicle (sitting on housing furniture counts) — a legacy behaviour Blizzard's own frames dropped, which could target the wrong unit or open a pet menu.
* (Auras) **Custom dispel colours are back.** Set your own colour per dispel type (Magic, Curse, Disease, Poison, Bleed/Enrage) in a new **Dispel Colors** section on the Colors page — one shared account-wide set. Both the debuff-icon border (via "Color by Dispel Type") and the Dispel Overlay follow it directly, with no separate mode to switch on. Defaults are the game's own dispel palette, so nothing changes until you edit it, and Reset restores the game colours. Each feature links to the Colors page.
* (Auras) Dispel colours now apply the moment you pick them — changing one no longer rebuilds the aura icons, so the brief flicker on every colour tweak is gone.
* (Auras) Fixed test mode showing the game's dispel colours instead of your own — the preview was overriding your Dispel Colors, so custom colours looked like they only worked on live frames.
* (Auras) **New: Optional Debuffs.** Hide nuisance debuffs from the debuff bar, on the Aura Filters page under **Debuffs → Optional Debuffs**. Everything in the list shows by default; unselect one to hide it. The Sated/Exhaustion (post-Bloodlust) family is hidden by default, with BG/Dungeon Deserter, Ride Along and the Mythic+ **Challenger's Burden** available as opt-in hides. Buffs stay opt-in via the buff presets and custom filters, so this list is debuffs only; and only debuffs the game leaves non-secret can be hidden (a 12.1 limitation — encounter debuffs stay visible).
* (Auras) **New: Debuff Filters.** The debuff bar is now filtered by categories on the Aura Filters page — Boss, Role, Priority, Crowd Control, Raid and Dispellable (by you or by anyone). "Show All Debuffs" keeps the old behaviour.
* (Auras) **The debuff bar now defaults to "All Debuffs".** Blizzard's category filters aren't exhaustive — some debuffs are tagged with none of the categories and slip through even with every one enabled, so "All Debuffs" is the only complete option. Category mode is still available; a caution note under it now explains the gap (the categories are Blizzard-defined and can't be widened) — the old "use the categories instead" nudge is gone. Existing profiles keep their current setting; Reset Page picks up the new default.
* (Auras) The "All Dispellable" debuff filter mode now actually filters — it previously showed every debuff.
* (Auras) New "Hide Long Debuffs" filter: hides debuffs over a duration threshold, with an option to keep boss, role and priority debuffs visible.
* (Auras) Buff and debuff filter preferences have been reset to new defaults as part of this rework.
* (Profiles) A settings page's Copy, Sync and Reset buttons no longer touch settings owned by a different page.
* (Auras) **New: Buff Filters.** The buff and defensive bars are now filtered by curated spell categories — healing, raid buffs, defensives, movement and more. Pick the buff bar's categories on the Aura Filters page and the defensive bar's on the Defensive Icon page.
* (Interface) **Aura Filters now shows what's inside a filter.** The page lists every filter on the left with its own checkbox, and selecting one shows its full spell list on the right — so choosing which filters a bar uses and editing what those filters contain happen in one place, instead of the filters being an opaque name you switch on and hope about. Every spell in a built-in filter can be unselected, and you can build your own filters, adding spells by ID or from the spell database. Buffs and Debuffs are tabs.
* (Auras) Filter presets start with passive "noise" auras unselected — mastery procs and auto-applied side effects. Everything stays listed on the Aura Filters page, one click to bring back.
* (Auras) Spell database updated with the latest harvest — two new filter categories, Tier Set Auras and Racials, plus dozens of new spells and placement fixes.
* (Tooltips) Aura tooltip Enable toggles now apply immediately. Anchor/Offset and Disable in Combat can't apply to 12.1 aura icons (game limitation) and are marked in place — they still work for Frame and Binding tooltips.
* (Aura Designer) The editor's preview canvas renders through the real 12.1 engine — what you see while styling is exactly what ships to the frames, including out-of-range fading.
* (Auras) **New: editable duration colours.** "Color by Time Remaining" now uses colour breakpoints you set yourself, in a new **Color by Time** section on the Colors page — each stop is one row with its colour, the range it covers and the point it takes over, and you can add or remove stops freely. Shared across buffs, debuffs, defensives and the Aura Designer, and defaulting to a bright green → gold → orange → red ladder.
* (Auras) **Colour by seconds remaining, or by percent of the aura's duration.** The Color by Time editor has a tab for each — they're separate colour ladders, so "under 3s" and "under 25%" can look different — and the defaults now line up, both splitting into even quarters. A percent ladder suits mixed durations, where a fixed number of seconds means very different things on a 6-second shield and a 5-minute buff.
* (Auras) **Duration text can blend smoothly between the stops.** A "Blend Colors Smoothly" toggle makes the countdown fade through the ladder instead of snapping band to band. This applies to duration text only, account-wide; the expiry Border and Tint reveals always step, which the editor now shows you directly — a "How this renders" legend previews each one exactly as it will appear, with that consumer's own controls on its row.
* (Aura Designer) **Each expiry alert picks its own seconds-or-percent.** The threshold beside every indicator's Expiry Warning has an s / % toggle on the value box, so one indicator can warn "below 5s" while another warns "below 30%", independent of what the duration text uses.
* (Auras) Every "Color by Time Remaining" setting — on the buff, debuff and defensive pages, and throughout the Aura Designer (including the new expiry Border/Tint reveals) — now carries a "Colors page" link that jumps straight to that shared breakpoint editor, expands it if collapsed, and highlights it.
* (Aura Designer) Test mode previews the Aura Designer through the real engine — every placed indicator renders with its configured spell, styling and animations, exactly as live.
* (Interface) **Border animations are now entirely DF's own.** Four new effects — DF Chase, DF Flash, DF Pixel and DF Proc — join DF Pulsate, DF Dash and Blink; the old library-backed effects are retired.
* (Auras) **Animated borders are available on the Missing-Buff icons**, with the full DF animation set. The animation driver is now shared, so animated borders are lighter across the board.
* (Auras) Border animations aren't offered on the aura icons themselves — buff, debuff, defensive and Aura Designer indicators. On 12.1 the game hides aura data in combat and forbids addons from touching aura icons while it's hidden, so an animated border there would break; those borders are static. Frame borders, the Missing-Buff badge and targeted-spell highlights are unaffected and still animate.
* (Auras) Out-of-range and dead-unit fading works on the 12.1 aura displays again — live and in test mode.
* (Auras) Aura text is sharper and countdown timers stay put — text now renders at its true size instead of being scaled up (which softened it, more so at larger sizes), and centred timers no longer drift or wobble as they tick down or when a text outline or shadow is enabled.
* (Aura Designer) Icon and square indicators have refreshed defaults — **DF Roboto SemiBold** with a drop shadow, slightly larger duration text and the stack count tucked into the bottom-right corner (was Friz Quadrata, no shadow, centred stacks) — matching the buff and debuff bars. Indicators still on the untouched old defaults are updated automatically; anything you've already customised is left alone. Newly placed indicators start with duration text coloured by time remaining (as they always have), and new or reset profiles have it on out of the box — existing profiles and already-placed indicators keep their current setting.
* (Aura Designer) The spell picker shows one unified list — the separate "Inferred Tracking" section is gone; every tracked aura now works the same way.
* (Aura Designer) Filter and debuff group boxes in the editor preview show greyed example icons, sized and arranged to your layout settings.
* (Aura Designer) Filter and debuff groups can be styled like placed indicators — Appearance, Border, Duration Text and Stack Count sections — and the preview's example icons wear your styling live.
* (Interface) The deprecated My Buff Indicators feature has been fully removed — the missing-buff display and the Aura Designer cover its use cases.
* (Internal) **The pre-12.1 aura pipeline is fully removed** — every aura surface now runs exclusively on the 12.1 engine. If any aura display behaves differently than before, please report it.
* (Dispel) Fixed the Top/Bottom/Left/Right Edge gradient styles rendering as health-shaped fragments after "On Current Health Only" had been active.
* (Auras) Fixed a doubled gap between filter blocks when more than one filter is enabled — rows are uniformly spaced.
* (Auras) **Centered growth works again** — rows set to grow from the center stay centered as icons appear and disappear, in combat too. The dropdown is now labelled **Grow**, with a **From Center** option.
* (Test Mode) **Test mode previews buffs, debuffs, defensives and missing buffs through the real 12.1 engine** — actual container rows with live-true layout, borders, fonts, animations and tooltips. While test mode is open, the game's own aura displays temporarily show sample data; everything restores when it closes.
* (Auras) The debuff "Color by Dispel Type" ring is now a flat square line matching your border's style and thickness, instead of the game's rounded ring art.
* (Borders) Fixed switching a border from Gradient back to Solid sometimes leaving the gradient stuck until a /reload on aura icon borders.
* (Profiles) Fixed profile resets not sticking for the Aura Filters — filters no longer flip back to an old preset after the next /reload.
* (Profiles) Fixed "Reset Profile to Defaults" leaving the Aura Designer and Text Designer untouched — a reset now rebuilds both designer libraries to their defaults.
* (Text Designer) Fixed the Text Designer going blank until a /reload after a profile reset. The default health text stays current/max.
* (Text Designer) The Texts and Text Groups tabs now show a live count of their enabled elements.
* (Interface) The settings window now defaults to **DF Roboto SemiBold**. Profiles still on the old default switch once — pick Friz Quadrata again to keep it. In-game frame text is unchanged.
* (Integrations) Removed the Click-Through Icons options — 12.1 aura icons are always click-through, so the toggles no longer did anything.
* (Class Power) Removed the Class Power Pips display and its settings page, along with its Test Mode toggle.
* (Performance) Disabling the Blizzard party/raid frames now fully shuts them down instead of just hiding them, stopping their background work. Toggling this (or Show Side Menu) now prompts for a UI reload.
* (Dispel) **The Dispel Overlay is now one unified system driven by the game's aura engine — and it covers boss debuffs (private auras) natively.** The old source selector is a single Enable toggle (existing settings migrate), colours come from the game's dispel palette, and everything else — border, glow, gradient, blend, darken, icons, pulse — stays yours to style, live and in combat. Also fixed a Lua error when opening Edit Mode with the overlay active.
* (Auras) Opening WoW's Edit Mode no longer floods the aura rows with random sample icons — rows hide during Edit Mode and restore when it closes.
* (Profiles) Refreshed the default profile's look — new installs and profile resets only. Tighter frames, buff borders on, Missing Buffs on by default, a cleaner pet style, and the Big/External Defensive filters no longer default on.
* (Profiles) Fixed several border settings (Hide Intro Flash, border Colour Source) silently reverting on profile export/import and party↔raid copies.
* (Test Mode) **Rebuilt the Quick Presets** (Static / Combat / Healer / Full). Each preset now sets every toggle, so they're reproducible — "Full" is genuinely everything — and applying one repaints the preview immediately.
* (Test Mode) Fixed the party-only Targeted List and Personal Targeted settings leaking into the raid preview.
* (Test Mode) The Targeted Spells and Targeted List toggles are greyed out in raid test mode — both are party-only features.
* (Boss Debuffs) **Boss debuffs are now part of the regular debuff row** — including private auras, with duration, stacks and dispel colouring. The separate Boss Debuffs display and its settings page are retired.
* (Missing Buffs) **Missing Buffs now work on 12.1 — including in combat and Mythic+.** The feature is display-only and driven by the game engine, so no combat delay and no Mythic+ blackout. In manual multi-buff mode every missing buff shows its own icon, and missing buffs now show for NPC party members too.
* (Defensives) Fixed a defensive appearing twice when it counts as both personal and external (e.g. Guardian Spirit) — externals someone cast on you sort first. Also removed a duplicated pair of Duration Offset sliders.
* (Auras) Debuff settings caught up with the buff row: Duration Format, Duration and Stack colours, filters and Sort Order all drive the new rows; settings the rows can't provide are marked in place.
* (Click-Casting) Fixed right-click target/menu erroring with click-casting enabled — a 12.1 game bug; the workaround retires automatically once the game fixes it.
* (Auras) **Debuffs now render through the 12.1 aura engine** — the last row on the legacy path, which could show nothing in combat. Layout, borders, text and sort work like the buff row, and a new "Dispel Border Inset" slider positions the dispel ring.
* (Auras) Buff "Sort Order" works again — Time Remaining and Alphabetical apply natively, in combat too.
* (Auras) New "Hide Long Buffs" filter: hides buffs whose total duration exceeds a threshold — e.g. hour-long food buffs. Permanent buffs are also hidden while this is on.
* (Auras) **Masque skinning support has been retired** — the new 12.1 aura icons can't be skinned by third-party addons, so the Masque option on the Integrations page no longer did anything and has been removed. DF's own border settings always apply.
* (Auras) Texture-style aura borders no longer scatter, lose their colour or vanish until a /reload — and fine border detail stays crisp at small icon sizes.
* (Auras) "Color by Time Remaining" works again on duration text, ticking in combat — fixed time steps (red under 5s, orange under 15s, yellow under a minute).
* (Auras) Buff and defensive icon text share one styling system, adding Duration and Stack colour options. The "Short" format no longer shows a stray space.
* (Auras) Fixed Icons Per Row wrapping one icon early.
* (Auras) Aura rows honor your layout settings again — anchor, direction, wrap, offsets, spacing, size and scale were previously ignored.
* (Auras) Aura settings apply in real time again — sliders re-flow the row live during the drag.
* (Interface) Settings the 12.1 rows can't provide are marked in place: "Min Stacks to Show", "Icons Per Row" on vertical rows, and "Border Animation" on buff icons.
* (Auras) Fixed an in-combat error that permanently froze a frame's aura updates until reload. Stack counts now use the built-in display (shown at 2 or more).
* (Auras) New buff duration format option (Number / Short / Full).
* (Aura Designer) **The Aura Designer is fully rebuilt on the 12.1 aura system.** Every indicator type works again — and keeps working in combat — including animated borders, sound alerts and "Show When Missing". The few effects 12.1 can't support stay marked "Blizzard limitation" in the panel.
* (Aura Designer) Fixed layout groups stacking all their spells on one spot — grouped indicators arrange into their grid again, and a missing buff leaves its slot empty.
* (Aura Designer) Adding spells to a layout group now uses the full searchable spell picker — click Icon or Square to drop a spell in, and the picker stays open for adding several.
* (Aura Designer) **New: Other Buffs tab.** Track any buff on your frames no matter who cast it — for example, Power Infusion on anyone in your group — with the same indicators, effects and sound alerts. Your own class's spells now live under the "My Buffs" tab.
* (Aura Designer) New "Others Only" option on Other Buffs effects and filter groups: only show the effect when someone else cast the buff — your own casts still show on the regular buff bar.
* (Aura Designer) A spell can be tracked in one tab at a time — the picker shows where a spell already lives, so the same buff never renders twice.
* (Aura Designer) Layout groups and filter groups are available on the Other Buffs tab too, shared across all your specs.
* (Aura Designer) **New: Debuffs tab.** Give debuff categories their own icon rows on the frame — for example, crowd control in its own spot with its own icon size. Tick a group's categories, set its layout, and those categories leave the main debuff bar automatically. Each group has its own dispellable mode and "Hide Long Debuffs" option.

* (Aura Designer) My Buffs now reacts only to your own buffs — another player's cast of the same spell no longer lights your indicators, effects, or groups. Use the Other Buffs tab to track a buff from anyone.
* (Auras) Each Aura Filters tab opens with a line saying what you can do there: buff filters are wholly yours to edit or replace, while the debuff categories are Blizzard's and fixed. The old Aura Filter Setup wizard has been removed; use the Reset Page button to return filters to their defaults.
* (Interface) Overrides now read the same way across the whole addon: auto layouts and Aura Filters use one coloured dot — with a hover tooltip saying what's overridden — in place of the old mix of stars and boxes, and every reset-to-default control shares one red icon style.
* (Auras) Tuned the default buff-filter presets: some spells now default on or off (for example Infusion of Light and Immolation Aura start off), a few non-aura entries such as totems and guardians were dropped, and several spells moved to more fitting categories. Your own per-preset enable/disable choices are not affected.
* (Auras) **Duration bars can colour by remaining time.** A new Color Mode on the Buffs, Debuffs and Defensive Icon duration-bar sections (and on Aura Designer group cards) adds three colour curves alongside the existing static colour: **DF Smooth**, which blends through the addon's expiry palette, **DF Stops**, which shows that same palette as four hard bands so the bar reads like stepped duration text, and **Classic**, a traditional green-to-red. The bar's colour walks the curve as the aura drains. Note this tracks the *proportion* of the aura remaining rather than a number of seconds, and the curve colours are fixed to the default palette — the duration *text* is what follows your own Color by Time breakpoints. Texture and Bar Color grey out while a curve is selected, since the curve supplies both. The default duration-bar gap is also now 1 (was 2).
* (Auras) **Fixed duration bars filling up instead of draining.** The bars were inheriting the game's default counting direction, which measures *elapsed* time — so a "duration bar" started empty and filled as the aura ran out, the opposite of what the setting describes. They now count remaining time and drain, as intended. Reverse Fill still mirrors which edge the bar drains toward.
* (Aura Designer) **Placed icon and square indicators now have a Duration Bar too.** Previously the duration-bar strip was only offered on Layout Groups; each individually placed icon/square now has its own Duration Bar section with the same options — enable, position, height, gap, Color Mode (Static / DF Smooth / DF Stops / Classic), texture, colours, and reverse fill.
* (Aura Designer) **Bar indicators gain a Color Mode.** The standalone Bar indicator now has the same **Color Mode** (Static / DF Smooth / DF Stops / Classic) as the other duration bars, in its Texture & Colors section. Pick a curve and the bar's fill reddens as the aura drains (Bar Texture and Fill Color grey out then, since the curve supplies both). This is a bar's proper "expiry colour" — the Expiration section on a bar handles only a Text/Glyph alert.
* (Aura Designer) **New Expiry Alert "Border" and "Tint" modes.** Alongside Custom Text and Glyph, a placed icon/square's Expiry Warning can now show a coloured **frame** (Border — in three thicknesses) or a **solid wash over the whole icon** (Tint) when the aura is about to expire. Either matches the icon size automatically (with an Inset to nudge it), takes an Opacity, and its colour can be a fixed pick **or** follow the same **Color by Time** breakpoints as your duration text — so it reddens as the aura runs down, in step with the numbers. On **bar** indicators the reveal offers a Text or Glyph alert only — a bar's *colour* expiry is its own fill via the Duration Bar's Color Mode (a DF Smooth / DF Stops / Classic curve reddens it as it drains), so a Border/Tint overlay isn't offered there. The Expiration panel has an Enable toggle and a Type dropdown, and shows only the controls that apply to the type you pick. Fully combat-safe (driven render-side, no reliance on reading the remaining time).

* (Interface) **The settings window has been rebuilt on one shared foundation.** Every surface — the options pages, the Aura and Text Designers, the spell and icon pickers, the frame movers, Pinned Frames, Search and Test Mode — used to build its own boxes, hover states and row geometry, so they drifted apart over time and a change to the look had to be made in a dozen places. They all come from one factory now, so a box, a button or a row looks and behaves the same wherever you meet it.
* (Interface) **Fixed borders in the settings window thinning, looking uneven, or vanishing outright.** A one-pixel line can only be drawn cleanly when it lands exactly on your monitor's pixel grid; at most UI scales it lands between two rows and splits its ink across both, and at the faint greys this interface uses, both halves can fall below what a screen will show. It was worst while scrolling, where the line crosses the grid every frame. Borders are now drawn as textures the addon owns, thick enough not to care where they land, so they look the same at any scale and stay solid in motion.
* (Interface) **Consistent spacing throughout the settings window.** Section headers used to sit almost on top of the control below them, and the gap between two controls depended on which two they were — the same nominal gap varied by a factor of four across different pages. Spacing now comes from one set of numbers, measured rather than guessed. A run of checkboxes closes up so it reads as one list, while the gap to a different kind of control below stays full.
* (Interface) **Every settings page now follows one layout rule.** The left column holds structure and geometry (Settings → Layout → Size → Position); the right column holds styling (Appearance → Border → element extras). Pages that genuinely need the full width — Pinned Frames, Nicknames — still get it, and pages with no geometry/styling distinction at all (Tooltips, Settings, Sorting, Manage, Import/Export) balance instead. Applied across Pet Frames, Resource Bar, Missing Buffs, Defensive Icon, Group Labels, Frame, Dispel Overlay and Aura Filters. Three boxes that had crept to full width on ordinary two-column pages (Pet Frames' top pair, Fading's Health Threshold, Pinned Frames' Auto-Populate) are back to column width — a full-width box also drags both columns down to align, so they were skewing the pages they sat on.
* (Interface) **Fewer things to expand before you reach a setting.** Collapsible headers now mean one thing — "here is another one of these", like each icon on the Icons page or each highlight on Highlights. Headers that merely named a category (Layout, Appearance, Settings) are gone from the Buffs, Debuffs, Personal Targeted and Targeted List pages. On the **Icons** page this went a level deeper: each icon's Settings, Appearance and Position boxes were themselves collapsible on top of the icon section that already collapsed, so opening "Leader Icon" gave you three more things to open. Those boxes are now always open, and the section headers match the width of the boxes beneath them.
* (Interface) **Every confirmation and name prompt is now DandersFrames' own dialog.** All 26 of them used Blizzard's popup, which can't be themed to match the rest of the addon, can't hold a text field, and treats Escape as "hide this box" rather than "cancel what it was asking about". Renaming a profile, deleting a filter, importing a string and everything like them now go through one themed dialog that cancels properly.
* (Interface) **Tooltips work the same way everywhere.** They used to attach three different ways, appear from three different places, and follow three different anchors depending on which control you hovered. There is now one system: hover a setting's **label** to see its tooltip, and it appears just above the cursor rather than on top of the control you were about to drag. More settings have them too, though deliberately not all — a slider labelled "Max Buffs" explains itself, while "Inset" reads as jargon and now says what it does everywhere it appears.
* (Interface) **Settings that don't apply now grey out instead of disappearing.** Turning a feature off on the Targeted List, Personal Targeted, Buffs, Debuffs, Missing Buffs and Defensive Icon pages used to remove its controls from the page entirely, so the page reflowed and you couldn't see what you'd be turning back on. They stay put and grey, which is what the rest of the addon already did. Targeted List's border settings also move into their own Border box — they were rendering inside the bar-style group.
* (Auto Layouts) The page now shows a clear disabled state when the feature is off, matching the Aura and Text Designers. It was previously possible to add and edit layouts while Auto Layouts was switched off, with no indication they wouldn't be used.
* (Interface) **Targeted Spells has been removed.** The group/on-frame half of the feature depends on aura information 12.1 no longer exposes to addons, so it is gone along with the setup wizard that configured it. **Personal** targeted spells and the **Targeted List** are unaffected and stay where they are.
* (Interface) **"Preset" and "Template" now mean different things.** A saved Aura Designer or Text Designer setup is a **Template**; "preset" is reserved for the built-in aura filters and the export/test quick-picks. Your saved data is untouched — the underlying keys deliberately still say preset, because they travel in export strings and renaming them would break every string already shared.
* (Aura Designer / Text Designer) **Copy & Sync is gone from both designers; sharing is shown on the template bar instead.** These two pages differ from every other mode-specific page: they own a single setting — which template you're using — and the dropdown directly above the buttons already sets it. Two controls writing the same value is what made "Stop Syncing Only" appear to do nothing. The template bar now marks a shared template, names who else is using it (Party, Raid, Auto Layouts, Pinned Frames) and says that edits apply there too. To split a shared template off for one mode, use **Duplicate** — which also lets you name the copy.
* (Interface) **Aura Filters: clearer names and readable rows.** "Other Buffs" is now **Any Buff**, the buff sections are named for what they hold, and New Filter sits in the section it creates into. Every list uses the same checkbox, and a selected box means one thing throughout: this shows on your frames. Spell rows lost their per-row "i" button — the spell IDs it showed now ride along with the tooltip you already get from hovering the icon or name, so spells added by ID that the database doesn't recognise finally have a tooltip at all. Remove buttons on a hovered row no longer dissolve into the highlight, and both panels use the window's full height.
* (Interface) **A filter now tells you where it's used.** Under the selected filter's name: a state dot and the places it applies — "On · Buff bar (Party), Defensive Icon", or "Off · not in use". Editing a filter changes it everywhere, so this answers, before you touch anything, what else you're about to affect. It reads the live setup rather than a fixed list, including Aura Designer **filter groups** that link the filter, and it follows use *anywhere* — so a filter the Defensive Icon uses reads green even while it's unselected for the buff bar, which is correct and worth knowing. Hovering it explains the three scopes that make filters look broken after a Party/Raid switch: which filters are selected is per mode, a built-in filter's spells are per profile, and a custom filter's spells are shared by every profile on the account.
* (Interface) The debuff-category caution ("only All Debuffs shows every debuff") moved out of the page banner and into the filter list, directly under the All Debuffs switch, and only appears while that switch is off — next to the control it's about, and no longer displacing the page's own explanation.
* (Auras) **Buff and debuff ordering and limits moved to the Buffs and Debuffs pages.** Sort order, "My Auras First", reverse order, the maximum-duration cap and "Hide Permanent Auras" now sit in an **Order & Limits** box on the page whose bar they affect, alongside the rest of that bar's behaviour, rather than on the filter page. The Dispellable **Mode** dropdown moved with them.
* (Interface) Aura Filters gains the addon's standard **Copy / Sync / Reset** row, so a set of filters built for Party can be shared with Raid — which matters because filter *selection* is per mode, even though what a filter contains is not.
* (Interface) The Aura Filters search box now carries the same magnifier icon as the addon's main search, and the **Add from Database** button sits beside the Spell ID box, so both ways of adding a spell are on one row. The filter list is wider as a result.
* (Interface) The **Icons** page no longer nests collapsible sections inside collapsible sections. Each icon's settings open and close as one, instead of expanding to reveal three or four more things to expand, and the page is the same width as every other single-column page.
* (Interface) **The Targeted List page's box names say what they are** — "Show" is now "Show Text", "Font" is "Text Font", and four boxes that just said "Position" now name what they position.
* (Interface) The Tooltips page's boxes are paired by what you hover — Frame with Binding, Buff with Debuff, Defensive with Resurrection — so the two you'd want to keep in step sit side by side. A stray alignment marker that opened a ~70px hole in the left column is gone.
* (Interface) Fixed the settings menu's hover highlight blinking off between rows — a two-unit dead band between each pair of rows meant the highlight had nothing to sit on as the cursor crossed it. Also fixed the whole menu list sitting a fraction of a pixel off the display grid, which softened all 42 rows, and the scroll area clipping its contents against a fractional edge, which cut into any box near the top of a page.
* (Interface) Fixed drag-to-reorder lists (auto layouts, indicator order) accumulating enough positioning error down the list that adjacent row borders merged into a single line.
* (Interface) Sliders now fill their row like dropdowns instead of stopping short of it, and override lists show setting names rather than raw internal keys. The "See Also" links park at the bottom of a short page, where they read as the footer they are.
* (Frames) **Frame Level settings apply immediately again.** Changing a Frame Level did nothing until a `/reload`, because a rebuild never re-applied it. The sliders also show the level that's actually in use, and rows no longer overlap each other. The per-element **Frame Strata** dropdowns have been removed — z-order now runs through a single path rather than three copies that could disagree, and strata isn't something you need to set per element for that to work. The guidance that used to sit as 21 blocks of body text across the settings pages is now a tooltip on the control itself.
* (Interface) The "not yet available on 12.1" frosting is gone from the settings pages. Every control it covered is now either working or removed — nothing is left in the interface marked as blocked.
* (Test Mode) **Fixed frames staying stuck on test data until a `/reload`.** If test mode ended because you entered combat or changed zone — rather than because you switched it off — the fake aura data was never handed back, so your frames kept showing it.
* (Profiles) **Fixed a brand-new profile being run through the one-time upgrade steps meant for old ones**, which have nothing to upgrade and the wrong shape to upgrade from. Fixed one of those steps deleting Aura Designer configurations outright while re-scoping them per spec.
* (Auras) Fixed a dispel pulse continuing on two of its three groups after it should have stopped, a failed aura-border attachment giving up instead of retrying, and a stale cache of frame attributes surviving a rebuild.
* (Frames) **Fixed dead and offline units not updating their status text or their missing-buff badge.** A unit that died kept whatever its frame was showing a moment earlier — no "Dead" or "Offline" status, and a missing-buff badge still asking you to buff someone who could no longer receive it. Both corrected only when something else forced a full refresh, often when you died as well, which is what made it look like your own state mattered. Neither check was wrong; neither was being re-run. Most visible in follower dungeons, where companions go down often.
* (Profiles) Fixed Copy, Sync and Reset Page quietly leaving some settings behind on seven pages, with nothing to say they'd been skipped. Fading was the reported case.
* (Internal) Code cleanup: removed unreferenced functions, orphaned locale strings and permanently-disabled blocks. No behaviour change.
* (Auras) **New: Important Debuffs.** Boss, role and priority debuffs can now stand out in the normal debuff bar without moving them somewhere else — make them larger and mark them with a warning badge, so the debuff that matters reads at a glance among the rest. The new **Important Debuffs** section on the Debuffs page has the size step, badge size, corner and offset, and colours for both the badge and its mark. Off by default.
* (Auras) **Targeted List no longer loses the opening cast of a pull.** "Hide Out of Combat" was checking whether the caster was in combat before checking who the cast was aimed at — and a mob whose opening move is a cast isn't flagged in combat yet, so the cast you most want to see was dropped. The setting defaults on, so this happened out of the box (measured at 10 lost casts in a single 19-minute session). It still hides idle NPC chatter, but no longer costs you openers aimed at your group.
* (Auras) **Targeted List now picks up casts that were already in progress.** Walk into range, turn the camera, or have a mob join a pull mid-cast and that cast produced no bar at all — it only appeared on the mob's *next* one. Personal Targeted Spells always handled this; the list now does too.
* (Auras) **New: "Show Offscreen Nameplates" on the Targeted List and Personal Targeted Spells pages.** Both features can only see a cast if the caster has a nameplate, so with WoW's offscreen-nameplate setting off, an enemy behind you produces no cast bar — confirmed in game with a targeted, visibly-casting mob that wasn't picked up until you turned to face it. The checkbox changes that Blizzard setting directly, so it affects all nameplates and not just cast detection; the tooltip says so plainly.
* (Aura Designer) **Frame Level sliders now show their real value.** The Aura Designer reported a lower level than it actually rendered at, so layering it against the defensive icon or the aura bars meant guessing — the defensive icon had to be pushed to 85 to sit on top of something that read 30. Every level is now the absolute value it says, and the Aura Designer's default returns to 40 (existing profiles are migrated). `/df debug zorder` also covers the Aura Designer now, printing the level you set beside the level it renders at.
* (Aura Designer) Fixed two square-indicator bugs: "Hide Cooldown Swipe" still left a yellow sweep animating over the square, and "Hide Icon" turned a square back into an icon.
* (Aura Designer) **Fixed Expiry Alert glyphs drawing underneath the icon they belong to** — on the frames, in test mode and in the editor's preview canvas. Also fixed an expiry alert appearing on its own, with no indicator beneath it, when one was configured on an indicator set to "show when missing" (two settings that contradict each other, so the alert is no longer built there at all).
* (Test Mode) **The preview now updates as you drag.** Buff, debuff, defensive and missing-buff previews only refreshed when you released a slider — and some changes needed test mode toggled off and on before they showed at all. Every container surface now follows changes live while you drag, the way the Aura Designer's preview already did.
* (Interface) **Border thickness now means what it says on textured borders.** DF Glow, DF Bevel, DF Inset and DF Double only ever drew about a quarter of the thickness you asked for: the line inside each texture filled a fraction of the space allotted to it, so setting thickness 8 gave you roughly 2 pixels where a solid border gave 8. All four have been redrawn to fill properly, so a textured border now carries the same weight as a solid one at the same setting, and the corners are drawn to match the edges they join. Note: your existing borders will look noticeably thicker at the same number — lower the thickness to taste.
* (Interface) **The Debug Console is now one system.** Every trace in the addon routes into a single console with named categories, so capturing a problem means turning on the relevant category and reproducing it — rather than hunting for whichever per-feature flag happened to cover that code. Logs persist across `/reload` and can be exported as text, which is the thing to attach to a bug report. Noisy categories stay off unless you ask for them, and every category is listed before it has logged anything, so you can pre-disable the chatty ones and stop the trace you actually want being pushed out by the line cap. The old per-feature debug flags are gone — six of them had already stopped doing anything.
* (Interface) **One debug command form: `/df debug <command>`.** The debug commands are down from 36 to 25, with three overlapping pairs merged into single commands (auras, dispel, headers) and developer-only commands no longer listed on normal builds. Note: the standalone one-word `/dfsomething` commands are no longer registered. They put around 25 DandersFrames commands into the global slash namespace, where they collide with other addons and clutter every slash autocomplete, to document a spelling nobody needed twice. A diagnostic is now typed in full — `/dfpixelcheck` becomes `/df debug pixelcheck`, and likewise for the rest — so any macro using a one-word form or the short `/df pixelcheck` spelling needs updating. Everyday commands (`/df test`, `/df lock` and so on) are unchanged. `/rl` is kept, since it has no `/df` form to fall back on.

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) **Fixed hover keybinds never working on frames that appear after you open the settings window** — opening the Click Casting options replaced the internal frame that owns hover bindings with a piece of the settings panel, so every frame created from then on (arena and boss frames, nameplates, frames for people joining your group) silently never got its keyboard bindings, and the automatic repair could not fix it either. A reload was the only way back. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fixed keyboard binds going dead on every frame for a whole fight when combat interrupted a binding refresh — typically zoning into a raid and a pull starting seconds later. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fixed hover keybinds dying for the rest of the session on some frames after visiting player housing. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fixed cast-on-down silently switching itself off on Blizzard's own raid and party frames after every roster change. (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fixed pet frames never appearing in arena (2v2, 3v3 and Solo Shuffle). Arena counts as a raid to the game, so pet frames were being looked for on the raid frames — which arena does not use. They now build alongside the arena frames, and follow your Party pet settings. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Click Casting) Work that has to wait for combat to end — profile switches, frame registration, binding refreshes and keyboard-bind rebuilds — now runs from a single queue that always drains, instead of ten separate flags; a keyboard-bind refresh asked for during combat was previously dropped entirely. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Binding-settle timers are now deduplicated so repeated events reuse one pending pass, a background rescan that re-armed itself forever now stops once its work is done, and two setup steps that gave up when combat outlasted their single retry now retry until combat ends. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Applying and clearing bindings now tracks exactly which click attributes were written on each frame instead of a ~500-write blanket sweep, which also fixes the previous profile's action lingering on an unmodified mouse button until reload. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) **Removed:** the hidden per-binding "load only for these specs" field, which no settings screen could ever set and which could filter your binding list using unresolved spec data at login — per-spec click casting is unchanged via loadout-assigned profiles. (by Krathe)


### Known Issues (12.1 alpha)

* The 12.1 aura displays are rebuilt on Blizzard's new container system and are under active testing — please report any case where buff, debuff, defensive or missing-buff displays stop updating, **especially in combat**.
* A debuff that counts as both a Priority debuff and a Boss/Role debuff can show one icon per matching filter when both are enabled — the only duplicate case the new filter system can't remove. "Show All Debuffs" avoids it.
* Dispel Overlay: a unit with dispellable debuffs of two different types can show both type icons overlapped (rare).
* Aura Designer text colouring is drawn as a cover over the text: it ignores the out-of-range text fade, and group parts with their own inline colours keep them.
* Dragging certain aura sliders can briefly stutter.
* Settings-window borders re-derive their thickness from DandersFrames' own **UI Scale** slider (top of the settings window). Changing WoW's global UI Scale instead won't re-derive them for pages already on screen — reopen the window, or nudge the addon's own slider, if a border looks off after doing that.

## [4.8.0]

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) Fixed all binds being dead in your first arena or dungeon of a session until a reload. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed an empty "drag to move" box getting stuck on screen after a profile switch, surviving reloads. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Click Casting) Enabling a targeting fallback on a key that already does something now asks for confirmation and names what the key will stop doing.
* (Click Casting) "Clear Blizzard Bindings" now warns that clearing is permanent, and only clears when you press it.

## [4.7.5]

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) **Fixed keybinds going dead after hovering a party or raid frame (a 4.7.4 regression)** — keys now release the moment the cursor leaves a frame, with extra self-recovery layers if binds ever stick again. (by Krathe)

## [4.7.4]

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) Fixed a Lua error walking Blizzard unit frames after combat that could stop click-casting bindings from working on the default frames until reload — the frame scan now skips protected (secret) values introduced by recent client versions. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Keyboard binds that stop working mid-session now recover automatically after combat ends or a loading screen, instead of staying broken until a reload.
* (Click Casting) **Fixed keyboard and extra-mouse-button hover binds dying addon-wide mid-combat until a /reload** — hover binds are now owned by one permanent frame instead of the unit frame under the cursor, removing the cleanup step that could hit a dead frame reference and silently break every later hover. The automatic self-repair stays as a safety net, but the cause is gone. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fixed keyboard and mouse-wheel click-cast binds being silently dropped mid-hover during combat — the safety check that removes hover binds could misread the cursor as off the frame while the frame's position was briefly unreadable, wiping the binds until the frame was re-hovered. Binds are now only removed when the cursor is provably off the frame. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fixed binds on keys from international keyboard layouts (such as æ, ø or å) not casting on the frame under the cursor.
* (Click Casting) New "Always Cast" option in a binding's Advanced settings. When enabled, the key still casts with the spell's normal targeting if no other rule matches — so ground-targeted spells (like aimable Shaman totems) show their aiming circle when pressed while hovering nothing.
* (Click Casting) Frames that other addons register for click-casting are now only taken over if they are real unit frames — non-unit buttons (such as toy or action buttons) are left alone, and frames an addon explicitly unregisters stay unregistered.
* (Auras) Fixed a stream of blocked-action taint warnings in PvP instances (triggered while styling aura duration text) that could spill over and break Blizzard's chat or other addons until a /reload.
* (Bars) **Fixed health bars rendering solid green when a profile references a bar texture you don't have** — imported profiles often point at another addon's texture files; if that addon isn't installed (or its files changed), the bar showed WoW's green missing-texture state and class colours appeared broken. All bar textures now fall back to the stock texture with a one-time warning, on every update path (the fallback previously only applied when a frame was first created and was immediately overwritten). (by Krathe)
* (Bars) Fixed class-coloured health bars staying stuck on the gradient colour (usually green) after using or switching away from the Percent colour mode — the class/custom colour is now written directly to the bar texture, so it can no longer be masked by a leftover gradient tint. (by Krathe)

## [4.7.3]

### Bug Fixes

* (Bars) **Fixed health bars rendering solid green when a profile references a bar texture you don't have** — imported profiles often point at another addon's texture files; if that addon isn't installed (or its files changed), the bar showed WoW's green missing-texture state and class colours appeared broken. All bar textures now fall back to the stock texture with a one-time warning, on every update path (the fallback previously only applied when a frame was first created and was immediately overwritten). (by Krathe)
* (Bars) Fixed class-coloured health bars staying stuck on the gradient colour (usually green) after using or switching away from the Percent colour mode — the class/custom colour is now written directly to the bar texture, so it can no longer be masked by a leftover gradient tint. (by Krathe)

## [4.7.2]

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) Fixed a Lua error walking Blizzard unit frames after combat that could stop click-casting bindings from working on the default frames until reload — the frame scan now skips protected (secret) values introduced by recent client versions. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Keyboard binds that stop working mid-session now recover automatically after combat ends or a loading screen, instead of staying broken until a reload.

## [4.7.1]

### Bug Fixes

* (Text Designer) Element colour changes now take effect immediately while the colour picker is open, instead of only after closing it with OK. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) Opening a colour picker no longer counts as a colour change — the picker fired its change handlers once during setup, which could commit settings (such as a Text Designer element's colour override) without any edit. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed expiring border animations staying stuck on after the tracked aura was refreshed (for example re-casting a HoT in its pandemic window). (by Krathe)

## [4.7.0]

### Bug Fixes

* (Text Designer) **Restored health text lost when upgrading to 4.6.0** — the legacy-to-Text-Designer conversion keyed "did this profile use health text?" off an internal flag that never actually controlled the old display, so upgrading dropped the health text element for most converting profiles (and its cleanup pass could remove a working health element from profiles converted by earlier versions). The conversion now keys off the real setting — the health text Format, where only NONE means off — and profiles that already lost their health text get it rebuilt from their legacy settings on login. If you had deliberately deleted the auto-created health element, it may reappear once — delete it again and it will stay gone. The stray "%" cleanup now targets only profiles that genuinely had health text disabled. (by Krathe)
* (Profiles) **Selective export/import no longer silently drops settings** — the category lists had drifted behind the addon's settings, so a selective export was missing the entire Targeted List page, the buff/debuff border style and animation families, permanent movers, My Buff Indicators, out-of-range alpha values and several more (~180 settings). All now travel with their categories, and an internal audit keeps the lists complete going forward. Full-profile export was never affected. (by Krathe)
* (Profiles) **Export categories now match the addon's features** — the old "Icons" checkbox silently bundled five whole features (Targeted Spells, Targeted List, Missing Buffs, Defensives and the status icons); Text hid the Text Designer; Auras hid Boss Debuffs. The export/import picker now offers each feature as its own category — Dispel, Boss Debuffs, Missing Buffs, Defensives, My Buff Indicators, Targeted Spells, Targeted List, Text Designer and Status Icons included — so you can share exactly one feature's setup (or exclude one) honestly. Existing export strings keep working unchanged. (by Krathe)
* (Text Designer) **Imported profiles keep their Text Designer configuration** — importing any modern profile with the Text category selected silently wiped the imported Text Designer elements and rebuilt them from the legacy text settings (the legacy-import converter misidentified every modern export as a legacy one). Modern imports now leave the imported Text Designer intact; genuinely old exports still convert as before. (by Krathe)
* (Profiles) **Party/raid section-sync links now export and import** — the per-page "sync party & raid" toggles were left behind by both full and selective export (and reset when importing into a new profile). They now travel with full exports and with the Other category on selective exports. (by Krathe)
* (Debug) **Debug commands tidied and self-documenting** — new `/df help` lists the user commands, and `/df debug` now lists every available debug command with a one-line description (`/df debug on`/`off` controls debug logging explicitly). Support diagnostics (aura, click-casting, header, range and similar state dumps) remain available in all builds for troubleshooting; developer harnesses (performance suite, atlas browser, deep aura tooling and the like) now only register on alpha/beta builds; and nine obsolete one-off test commands from finished development work were removed entirely. (by Krathe)
* (Status Icons) **Role and raid-target icons no longer apply their Scale setting twice** — two update paths each applied the scale, so the icons actually rendered at scale-squared. They now render at exactly the size the slider says; with default settings the raid target icon becomes ~10% smaller and the role icon is unchanged. (by Krathe)
* (Auras) **"Hide Duration Above" no longer silently breaks after using Test Mode** — the aura duration text is now set up through one shared path. Previously, opening test mode (or dragging a duration slider before any timed aura had displayed) could disconnect the text from the visibility control that implements the threshold, so durations stayed visible above your cutoff until a reload. The buff/debuff border type colours also now come from one shared palette in test and live. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Mode accent now updates on the toolbar and Test panel buttons** — the changelog button at the top of the settings window and the Test panel's Enable/Disable button kept the hover tint of whichever mode they were first shown in, so they could flash the party accent in raid (or vice-versa). They now follow the current party/raid accent like every other control. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) **Absorb, heal-absorb and heal-prediction previews now render through the real bar code** — test mode used to hand-draw simplified copies of these bars, which could drift from what you actually see in dungeons (and did, before the recent pixel-perfect fixes). The previews are now pixel-identical to live by construction, including attached/overflow modes and the overshield glow. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) **Defensive bar preview now positions through the real layout code** — the test icons previously used their own copy of the grid layout that skipped pixel-perfect scale folding and pixel-grid snapping, so the preview could sit slightly off from live placement. One shared layout path now serves both. (by Krathe)
* (Internal) **Code cleanup, round one** — removed ~130 unused functions (including two entire superseded dialogs), 6 dead settings keys and ~140 orphaned locale strings identified by the 2026-07 code audit; raid defaults are now generated from party defaults (they were a 1,250-line hand-maintained copy that could silently drift); the live colour picker moved out of its misleadingly-named "Test" file; binding-row icons resolve through one shared helper. No behaviour change. (by Krathe)
* (Auras) **Removed the obsolete Blizzard aura source** — WoW 12.0.5 removed the API it relied on, and every profile has been force-migrated to the Direct API source since v4.2.x. The Aura Filters page loses its dead "Source Mode" dropdown (whose choice was silently reverted every login), and the setup wizard now goes straight to filter configuration. Direct API is simply how auras work now. (by Krathe)

## [4.6.0]

### Interface Overhaul

A top-to-bottom rework of the configuration UI so every panel shares one consistent look and behaviour.

* (Interface) **One shared widget toolkit** — buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, sliders, range sliders, text inputs, colour pickers, tooltips, info banners, tab strips and panel/section backdrops are now built from a single themed set of helpers instead of dozens of hand-rolled one-offs, so every control looks and behaves identically across the addon (consistent accent colour, hover and disabled states). (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Disabled settings grey out in place, addon-wide** — when a feature is turned off its options stay visible but dimmed and inactive (a consistent preview) instead of staying clickable or disappearing. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer / Text Designer) **Unified look** — both designers now share the same panel layout, preview frame, tab strip and column styling as the rest of the UI, so they no longer feel like separate tools. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reworked to match the standard UI** — the tab/sub-tab strip, designer-preset bar and grouped settings boxes now use the shared styling. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) **Page rebuilt** — restructured into grouped section boxes (Add / Saved / Received / Marker / Name Precedence) consistent with the other feature pages. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Consistent tabs, tooltips, banners & section boxes everywhere** — Options, Click Casting, Search, Auto Profiles, Test Mode and the icon library now share one tab style, one tooltip system, and the same info banners and settings-group boxes. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Material Symbol icons** normalised to a consistent size and padding, with new icons added. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Wording & value consistency** — standardised inconsistent labels and dropdown values across the settings UI; the Settings-panel font outline now offers its full option set. (by Krathe)
* (Localization) Wrapped the remaining hardcoded UI text so settings labels and Click Casting messages translate properly. (by Krathe)

### New Features

* (Highlights) New **Hide on Tanks** option — suppresses the aggro highlight on tanks so it only flags when a DPS/healer pulls. Off by default. (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Added an optional **power bar** for pet frames, with adjustable height and colour. Off by default. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned sets can now **anchor to your raid/party frames** instead of the screen, tracking them as they move or resize. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Auto Layouts) Moving raid frames while an auto layout is active now edits **that layout**, via its own Unlock button. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Each set's **Horizontal/Vertical Spacing** now inherits from the based-on mode, overridable per set. (by Krathe)
* (Options / Click Casting) Inline "Note:" labels are now consistent and no longer show a stray "?". (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Notes, tips and banners now share one colour system** — caveats, tips, recommendations and warnings across the settings UI are coloured from a single set of tones (info, caution, danger, success) instead of assorted one-off colours, so a note's importance reads the same everywhere. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) Drag-to-reorder lists (role, class and group order) now use a clearer reorder-handle icon. (by Krathe)
* (Pixel Perfect) The Display page now shows the **UI Scale** that gives exact 1:1 pixel rendering at your resolution (or confirms you're already there) — purely informational, it never changes your scale. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting / Aura Designer) The **Priority** sliders now read left-to-right as Low → High — **higher number wins**, matching every other slider (right = more). Your existing priorities are migrated automatically, so only the displayed number changes, not which binding or aura takes precedence. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Fonts) **A corrupted font setting can no longer break the addon on login** — font name, size and outline values are validated before use, so a bad value in an imported or hand-edited profile now degrades to default text styling instead of erroring out the entire frame layout (which showed up as missing debuffs, broken test mode and blank settings values). (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames / Test Mode) Fixed a Lua error that spammed and froze the UI (forcing a reload) when previewing pinned frames containing NPC/boss units — role icons no longer error on units without a role. (by Krathe)
* (Sorting) Fixed the combat-status banner on the Sorting page sometimes appearing as a blank white box instead of its coloured status. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) Test mode and settings changes can no longer disturb your **live** raid frames — group order and positions are always driven by the secure layout, fixing the grouped-raid inversion that previously needed a `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) Retired an obsolete internal reverse-group-order setting that could invert raid groups; group order is controlled entirely by **Group Display Order** / **My Group First**. (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fixed a combat error (blocked action) when a pet appeared, died, or was dismissed during combat — pet frames now hide combat-safely. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) **Border Inset** is now honoured by texture-style borders, and updates live. (by Krathe)
* (Shields) Absorb and heal-absorb overlays now cover the health bar with **no gap** — flush to the edge when the frame border is opaque or off, keeping a small inset only when the border is translucent (so the shield doesn't show through it). (by Krathe)
* (Pixel Perfect) **Center-aligned** frames now snap to the physical pixel grid, so borders stay crisp instead of doubling or dropping a side — party frames live, and raid frames in test mode (live raid keeps Blizzard's secure positioning). The overshield line indicator and the solid highlight border snap to whole pixels too. (by Krathe)
* (Text) Fixed a stray health value (often a "%") appearing for users who never turned health text on. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) Fixed an error matching nicknames against boss/NPC names on pinned frames in encounters.
* (Localization) Test Mode, position, grid, Text/Aura Designer and auto-profile labels now translate properly.
* (Raid) Test mode now matches live raid frame positions in flat and grouped layouts, including Center alignment. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) Group labels no longer linger over the flat raid grid after switching from a grouped layout. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed click-through not applying to stacked defensives that appear mid-combat. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Health-bar **Tint** now fills the whole bar instead of leaving an edge gap under a border. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed aura **borders** showing the wrong colour/thickness on imported or older profiles. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed imported/older auras sometimes showing **no indicators** until re-saved. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The fill-**Bar** indicator's expiring **Tint** controls are now available in the editor. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed **Import Buffs Tab Defaults** not carrying the buff border toggle to new icon auras. (by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) **Smooth Bar Animation** now actually smooths the bar's fill. (by Krathe)
* (Buffs / Debuffs) Fixed pixel-perfect aura icons being mis-sized when a custom **Border Thickness** was set. (by Krathe)
* (Status Icons) The **Frame Level** slider now previews live while dragging. (by Krathe)
* (Profiles) The **Border Color Source** (Class/Role) for Missing Buff/Defensive icons is now kept on single-category export/import. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) A binding's **combat condition** now shows in the list immediately instead of after a reload. (by Krathe)
* (Debuffs) Removed the defunct **Highlight Dispellable** toggle (handled by Dispel Overlay). (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Pet **name and health text show again** (font/anchor/colour settings now apply). (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) An empty party pet frame no longer lingers over the raid frames when a member summons a pet in a raid. (by Krathe)
* (Global Font) **Apply to All** now also restyles the Text Designer text (Name / Health / Status and custom elements); the Affected Elements list was updated to match. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) The frame **Unlock/Lock** toolbar button now updates its label correctly in raid mode (it previously stayed on "Unlock" after unlocking). (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) The Mythic layout's fixed-range badge no longer overflows its button. (by Krathe)
* (General) Fixed the doubled "v" in the version line printed on login. (by Krathe)

## [4.5.0]

### New Features

* (Targeted Spells) On-frame targeted spell icons are back for **party frames** — an icon appears on the party member an enemy is casting at, so you can spot incoming danger at a glance. Works in dungeons, arenas, and the open world; enable it under **Indicators → Targeted Spells**. Party members who share the same class, role, race, and sex can't be told apart and won't show an icon — you'll be warned by name when that happens. Technique credit to Ellesmere (EllesmereUI). Raid frames aren't supported.
* (Aura / Text Designer) New **Designer Presets** — save named presets of your Aura Designer and Text Designer setups and choose which one each mode uses. Each **Party / Raid** tab gains a **Preset** selector plus **New / Duplicate / Rename / Delete** (a non-deletable **Default** is always available), so you can build different setups — a focused tank layout vs a minimal one, say — and switch between them without rebuilding. Raid auto-layouts can point at their own preset, and editing a preset updates every consumer using it. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) You can now have **more than two pinned sets** — up to four, and **Party and Raid are independent** (e.g. four sets in raid, one in party). The set editor gains a **+ Add** button to create a new set and an **×** on the active tab to remove one (the last set can't be removed). A counter shows how many sets are defined and how many are currently active, since each enabled set is a live frame group. Use **Copy Pinned Frames** if you want both modes to match.
* (Pinned Frames) New per-set **Hide Auras** and **Hide Status Icons** toggles — strip the buff/debuff (and Aura Designer) display or the status icons from a pinned set for a clean, health-only highlight. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) New **Exclude Self** option per pinned set — keeps you out of that set's Auto-add (Tanks/Healers/DPS), handy for Augmentation Evoker and other buff-others playstyles. Works in groups and solo. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) New **Disable in PvP** toggle (on by default) — pinned frames stay dormant in arena and battlegrounds, where the constant unit churn could otherwise hurt performance. Turn it off to highlight teammates there. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Each pinned set can now choose its own **Aura Designer** and **Text Designer preset** — pick one in Frame Style, or leave it on **Inherit** to follow the mode's preset. Lets a highlighted set show a different aura/text layout from your normal frames. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames are now **independently customisable** per party/raid mode: a **Frame Style** section with a **Based on** selector (Party / Raid, defaulting to their own mode) sets the inherited look, and the settings that also exist on your main frames — **Width**, **Height** and **Scale** — inherit the chosen frames' value and can be overridden per set, each showing a star and a reset button, just like an auto-layout override. An **Override Border** toggle lets a set take its own border/glow (snapshotted from the chosen frames, then fully editable, with a one-click reset to re-inherit) to make highlighted players stand out. A party-only **Show in Solo Mode** toggle keeps them visible when you're not grouped. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Targeted Spells) Tuned the default look of the important-spell **Highlight** for both party and personal targeted spells — a thinner dashed border with a softer alpha, plus refreshed spacing/offset defaults. Only affects new profiles; existing setups are unchanged.
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames now **lock and unlock together with your main frames** — there's no separate per-set Lock Position toggle any more. Unlock your party or raid frames and the pinned sets for that mode show their drag handles too; lock again and they all settle. Each set's handle also opens the same **fine position panel** as the party/raid frames (precise X/Y nudge, centre, reset), so you can place a pinned set to the pixel. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frame settings are now **global per party/raid mode** and no longer saved into auto layouts — a raid auto layout only controls whether each pinned set is **shown** for that layout. This removes the stale/blank pinned data and editor mismatches that came from pinned settings being stored per-layout, and pinned edits now take effect live. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) The binding editor no longer shows the Advanced options section for Target Unit and Context Menu binds — those settings don't apply to those actions.
* Refreshed the DandersFrames addon icon.
* (Out of Range) The out-of-range text fade is now a single **Text Alpha** control that dims the whole Text Designer overlay together, replacing the old per-element Name/Health alpha sliders that no longer did anything once the Text Designer took over text rendering. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The party and personal targeted-spell icons now use the **full border toolkit** — style, colour, alpha, inset, blend mode, shadow and animation — the same controls as the rest of the addon, and the important-spell highlight is now its **own border** you can style separately. Existing highlight settings carry over. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Status Icons) The drop shadow shows again on the **AFK timer** and **all status-icon text**. A 12.0.7 font change stopped the old fontstring-level shadow from rendering, so status-icon and timer text lost their shadow while the rest of your text kept it; they now apply the shadow through the font itself like everything else. The global **Shadow X / Y / Color** sliders also preview live again while dragging — on live, pinned, and test frames — instead of only after a reload. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Animated borders (dashed / marching-ants and the other motion effects) no longer freeze after a frame hides and re-shows, or an aura icon is recycled from the pool — they kept their "already running" marker even though the underlying animation had stopped, so they sat static until a setting was nudged to force a restart. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Fixed pixel-perfect borders dropping a side, switching sides when an icon moved, or looking thicker than their set size. Icon/frame edges are now snapped to the physical pixel grid, so a 1px border lands cleanly on a single row of pixels instead of straddling two. Also fixes a small icon-to-border gap that showed on freshly-added Aura Designer indicators in the preview. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The on-frame targeted-spell duration timers now count down in Test Mode instead of sitting on a frozen value, so you can preview the look while configuring them. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed a Lua error that could spam in combat when an aura indicator used a **Gradient** border together with **Expiring Colour Override** — the expiring colour resolves through the aura's protected duration in combat, and the border's gradient-clear step rejected it. The border now recolours cleanly. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Text Designer elements now update on pinned frames right away when you add or edit them, instead of only showing up after toggling test mode.
* (Raid) **Group Display Order** and **My Group First** now reposition the frames live: changing the order (or toggling My Group First) moves the raid frames immediately instead of only moving the group labels and leaving the frames in default order until the next roster change. The **My Group First** setting also now saves when toggled while editing an active auto layout, instead of being lost on reload. (by Krathe)
* (Arena) Fixed teammates who load in late sometimes staying missing for the whole round, the frame order breaking after a mid-match reload, and frames staying hidden after a reload during a match. (by Krathe)
* (Range) The frame border (and other element borders) now reliably **fade out of range**, preserved across border re-renders. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) The missing-buff icon no longer flags a **cross-faction group member in the open world** as needing a buff you can't actually cast on them — it only appears where the buff is castable (e.g. inside instances). (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icon) The defensive cooldown icon and its border now render **above auras** and stay co-planar with the icon. (by Krathe)
* (Role Icons) **Show Tank / Healer / DPS** toggles now apply live without a `/reload`, and are properly decoupled from the Hide-in-Combat gate. (by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fixed missing frames for players who are still loading in, such as battleground backfills joining mid-match. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The **Name Text** and **Health Text** indicators (recolour the unit's name/health text on aura presence) work again now that the Text Designer owns that text — they recolour the Text Designer's name/health elements, including the expiring colour fade. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Filters) Removed the "Important Spells" buff and debuff filter, which Blizzard removed from the game.
* (Click Casting) Fixed Target Unit and the unit menu not working when bound to a keyboard key or an extra mouse button since the 12.0.7 patch — now fixed on DandersFrames, Blizzard's default unit frames, and other unit-frame addons. Technique credit to Ellesmere (EllesmereUI).
* (Buff/Debuff) **Show Buffs / Show Debuffs** toggles now apply live without a `/reload` — already-shown auras hide or reappear immediately instead of lingering until the unit's next aura change. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames now reappear when you zone into a battleground or arena, instead of staying hidden until a `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned & Raid Frames) Fixed frames cascading into a diagonal "staircase" when switching their grow direction between Horizontal and Vertical — the layout now re-flows cleanly without a `/reload`. Pinned layout changes (direction, spacing, size) made during combat are also applied when combat ends, instead of being dropped until the next change. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) A border set to thickness **0** now hides cleanly across every style, while any border animation keeps running. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Fixed a doubled glow that could appear on the **PROC** border animation when it re-triggered; the PROC start-flash is now an opt-in option. (by Krathe)
* (Personal Targeted Spells) The personal targeted-spell display now honours your **raid** and **party** settings separately — disabling it on the raid tab no longer leaves it showing in raid (the whole feature was reading the party settings, ignoring raid's enable / size / position / border). (by Krathe)

## [4.4.1]

### Bug Fixes

* (Text Designer) Fixed the Text Designer being left out of the 4.4.0 release, which left its settings page empty and could make frame text disappear. It is now included and working.

## [4.4.0]

### New Features

* **Text Designer** is now available in all versions (previously alpha-only) — add any number of custom text elements to your unit frames, each with its own font, size, colour (or class colour), anchor and position. Elements can show live data: identity (name, class, level, race, faction, group number, custom text), health, power, shields & heals, dead/offline status, threat and range. Find it under the **Text** tab.
* (Frames) **Unified border system** — every border (frame, buff/debuff icons, aura bars, defensive icons, missing-buff, resource bar, pet frames, targeted spells) now runs through one engine with consistent **Style / Colour / Alpha / Gradient** controls. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Added optional **border animations** — 10 effects (pulse, wipe, ripple, segment reveal, sides/corners-only, proc glow, dash, and more), available wherever a border is drawn. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Status icons now use crisp **modern Blizzard atlas art** (ready check, summon, resurrect, phased, vehicle, main tank/assist, AFK), with automatic fallback to the legacy texture. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Each status-icon section header now shows a **live preview** — the icon swatch, or its status text when "Show as Text" is on. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) New **BG objective carrier icon** — lights up a friendly party/raid member carrying a battleground objective (flag or orb). (by Krathe)
* (Role Icon) **Custom role icons** — choose Blizzard, DF, or your own external texture per role (Tank / Healer / DPS). (by Krathe)
* (AFK Icon) Dedicated **Timer Text** controls for the elapsed-time counter (font, size, outline, colour, offset). (by Krathe)
* (Fonts) Bundled **Roboto Mono** (SemiBold/Bold) — a monospaced option for perfectly static countdown text. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) New **in-combat indicator** — a small crossed-swords icon lights up when a unit is in combat. Off by default, with its own position and size controls. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) Added `/df clearoverride <key|prefix|all>` to **remove a stuck per-layout override** the settings UI can't reach. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) New **Nicknames** feature — show custom names on your party and raid frames. Build a prioritised list from your friends, guild and group, or type names in by hand, and choose how matches are made. Optionally mark nicknamed players with brackets (or other styles) and share your own nickname with the group. Find it under **General → Nicknames**. (by Maelareth)
* (Nicknames) The **Add from** lists (friends, guild, group, Battle.net) put **online members first**, and you can **favourite** people with the star to pin them to the very top. (by Maelareth)
* (Resource Bar) Added a **Color Mode** (Power Type / Class / **Custom**) with a custom-colour picker, and a **Texture** dropdown so the resource bar can use any statusbar texture. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) New **Background Color** effect — colour a frame's background when an aura is active (Replace or Tint), with the same Expiring colour override, Pulsate and out-of-range handling as the other effects. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) The missing-buff border can now use **Class or Role colour** instead of a single fixed colour. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Performance) The expiring-border ticker now **throttles and staggers per entry** to cut overhead when many borders are expiring at once. (by Krathe)
* (Defaults) Tuned some new-profile defaults — buff icon sizing/spacing, stack-count offsets, text outline shadows, and indicator border insets. (by Krathe)
* (Reduced Max Health) The bar's default colour is now a **translucent grey** instead of opaque black so it reads clearly on a dark health bar; profiles still on the old default are migrated automatically. (by Krathe)
* (Boss Debuffs) **Border Scale** can now go negative to hide the icon border. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Reorganised **every status-icon's settings into collapsible Settings / Appearance / Position boxes**, and changes now apply to live frames instantly — no `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Renamed **"Raid Target Icon" → "Target Marker Icon"**, with a header preview showing the four common markers. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) The separate **Status / Ready** and **Role / Leader** preview toggles are now a single **Icons** toggle, matching the live status-icon grouping. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) The **override tooltip and `/df overrides` now read clearly** — each changed setting shows as a breadcrumb path with its value, and the override counts agree everywhere. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Expiring health-bar highlights now **pulse in unison** across all frames instead of each frame pulsing on its own timing. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The health-bar indicator's **Tint** mode has a new **Tint Entire Bar** option — tint the whole bar including the missing-health portion. (by Krathe)
* (Text) The built-in Name, Health, and Status text settings are now handled entirely by the **Text Designer** — the older text pages are hidden and your existing text is converted to Text Designer elements automatically. Customise all frame text under the **Text** tab.
* (Resource Bar) Added **Maelstrom** and **Pain** to the per-power resource colour options, so Shaman and Vengeance Demon Hunter resource bars can be recoloured. (by Krathe)
* Moved **Pixel-Perfect Scaling** to **General → Settings**, since it applies globally to both party and raid. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) **Northern Sky Raid Tools compatibility** — when NSRT is also set to put nicknames on DandersFrames frames, a one-time prompt lets you choose which addon decides the names shown on your frames (changeable later under **General → Nicknames → Name precedence**). (by Maelareth)
* (Aura Designer) Alert sounds now play on the **Master** channel by default, so they stay audible even with Sound Effects or Music muted; a new **Channel** dropdown lets you pick a different channel. (by Krathe)
* Ready for **patch 12.0.7** — the addon-compartment tooltip and the frame mover's Ready Check action keep working on the new patch. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Pinned Frames) Fixed a freeze ("script ran too long") when entering an arena or battleground; pinned frames now stay dormant in instanced PvP, with an option to re-enable them. (by Krathe)
* (Sorting) Group frames no longer **reshuffle mid-fight** when members share the same sort position, and hidden unit information during **Mythic+ encounters** no longer causes errors. (by Krathe)
* (Status Icons) Fixed an error from **AFK tracking** during Mythic+ encounters. (by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) The colour now updates correctly when your **power type changes** (for example, on shapeshift). (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) While in a raid you can now only edit the **active layout**, so editing no longer disturbs your live raid frames. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed frame-level effects sometimes **missing from the live preview**. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed icon positions **drifting** from where test mode shows them at non-default icon scales. (by Krathe)
* (Reduced Max Health) The reduced-max-health overlay now follows the **health bar's orientation**, including vertical bars. (by Krathe)
* (Range) Frame and element borders — including Aura Designer border effects — now reliably **fade out of range**. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) No longer flags a **cross-faction group member in the open world** for a buff you can't cast on them. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icon) The defensive cooldown icon and its border now render **above auras**. (by Krathe)
* (Role Icons) **Show Tank / Healer / DPS** toggles now apply live without a `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Indicators are torn down when the Aura Designer is disabled, and re-applied on **profile swap**. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The targeted list no longer appears in **test mode** when the feature is disabled. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Replace-mode health-bar highlight fixes — no more **flicker** on phased or out-of-range units, no **bleeding over the frame border**, and the expiring **Pulsate** option now works. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Replaced several test-mode buff/debuff preview icons that pointed at art removed in Midnight, so they no longer render blank. (by Krathe)
* (Designers) The Aura/Text Designer preview now rebuilds to the **frame size of the auto layout being edited**, and edits keep applying to test-mode frames after **switching between auto layouts**. (by Krathe)
* (Frames) Bars referencing a **texture you don't have installed** now fall back to the bundled default with a one-time notice, instead of rendering black. (Requires WoW 12.0.7.) (by Krathe)

## [4.3.12]

### New Features

* (Heal Prediction) Added a "Show Heals From" option — All Incoming, My Heals, Others' Heals, or Split — letting you choose which incoming heals the bar shows. Split draws your heals and other healers' heals as separate coloured segments. (PR #109 by Krathe)
* Added a `/df attached` command that lists other addons attaching castbars, cooldowns or auras to your frames — handy for telling apart DF features from another addon's. (PR #104 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Added a **"Target unit when click-casting"** option — click-casting a spell on a frame can now also make that unit your target. Set it globally in the Click Casting profiles panel, or override it per-binding under Advanced → Macro Options. (PR #116 by Krathe)
* (Fonts) Expanded text styling across every font setting: added **Monochrome**, **Monochrome Outline**, and **Monochrome Thick Outline** outline styles; a drop **shadow can now be combined with any outline** (each font now has its own Shadow checkbox) instead of being mutually exclusive; and a new **Crisp Font Rendering (SDF)** option in Global Fonts smooths text edges for sharper text. (PR #115 by Krathe)
* (Frames) Added border customization under Frame → Appearance: a **Border Style** option (Solid or Texture), where the Texture style can use any border registered with SharedMedia (the built-in set, or ones added by other media addons), plus a **Border Size** slider to adjust thickness. (PR #119 by Krathe)
* (Frames) Added a **Use Class Color** option for the frame border, colouring each frame's border by the unit's class. (PR #120 by Krathe, suggested by maelareth)
* (Frames) Added bundled frame border textures — **DF Glow**, **DF Bevel**, **DF Inset**, and **DF Double** — selectable under the Texture border style (and shared with other media-aware addons). Designed with square corners for rectangular frames; the bevel/inset shade with the chosen border colour for a 3D edge. (PR #121 by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Absorbs) Fix the absorb / heal-absorb / heal-prediction bars leaving a sliver of the health bar showing when Reduced Max Health (Clip Health Bar) and a frame border were both enabled. The bars were inset by the border width even at the internal clip edge, where there is no border. (PR #124 by Krathe)
* (Absorbs) Fix the overflow absorb bar not fading out of range when using the Attached + Overflow absorb style. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) Replaced the unclear "OOC" toggle label with clear "Combat" and "Out of Combat" column headers. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) The class dropdown now uses the standard arrow instead of a stray yellow one. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix the colour picker's alpha not affecting the health bar indicator on live frames, and fix the Blend % slider reappearing in Replace mode after closing and reopening the GUI. (PR #102 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix the health bar indicator's expiring colour ignoring its own alpha — it reused the base colour's alpha instead. The expiring colour now uses its configured transparency, in both Tint and Replace modes. (PR #117 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Colour pickers now offer a Default button that resets to the configured default, matching the rest of the addon. (PR #103 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix a custom Replace-mode health bar colour flickering to full opacity on every health change. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) Fix editing a raid auto layout while not in a raid enabling the party Pinned Frames — the pinned-frame refresh targeted the live group's mode (party) instead of raid. (PR #125 by Krathe)
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private aura anchors remaining bound to the previous occupant of a unit slot after a roster change, causing icons to not appear on replacement players for the rest of the session. (PR #112 by Krathe)
* (Class Colors) The class colour list is now a single section instead of being split into two columns. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Renamed the "Cast on DOWN" option to "Cast on mouse down" and added a tooltip, clarifying that it only affects mouse clicks on frames (keyboard binds are unaffected). (PR #118 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Trinket and item keybinds now cast on mouseover, target, or self when those fallbacks are enabled — previously they always cast on your current target regardless of fallback settings.
* (Frame Movers) Fix the raid frames' unlock "Drag to move" text using a fixed fallback font instead of your Settings Font, so it now matches the party mover. (PR #122 by Krathe)
* (Heal Prediction) Fix the incoming-heal bar not keeping its size accurate as a unit's health changes while being healed. (PR #105 by Krathe)
* (Indicators) Renamed "Status Icon Text Settings" to "Icon Text Settings" for clarity. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Performance) Reduce the frame-rate hitch when joining a group: spec/talent update events fire in bursts as the client syncs data, and each one was triggering a full frame relayout. These are now coalesced into a single refresh. (PR #128 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix pet frames not attaching to the correct owner when custom sorting is enabled. (PR #108 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix pet frames reappearing after being turned off until a reload. (PR #108 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix grouped raid frames briefly jumping when interacting with the settings window: a redundant layout pass was re-firing the secure reposition even when nothing about the raid had changed. It now skips the reposition unless the sort order, group population, or layout actually changed. (PR #129 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix the Rows/Columns Grow From setting not always taking effect immediately when changed. (PR #134 by Krathe)
* (Range) Fix the frame border not fading out of range when Element-Specific Alpha is enabled — it was the only element the per-element fade didn't cover. Added a Border Alpha slider to control it. (PR #123 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Fix the Show Minimap Button and Hide Blizzard Player Frame toggles doing nothing when changed in Raid settings. They are now single global options on the Settings page, and the Visibility tab (whose options only apply to party/solo frames) is hidden in Raid mode. (PR #110 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Made the raid layout positioning options consistent between Group and Flat modes: Start/Center/End options are now labelled "Alignment", directional options use real directions (Left/Right or Top/Bottom), and these labels and their values now update live when you change the layout direction instead of needing the settings window reopened. (PR #114 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix grouped raid frames in vertical layout with Players Grow From set to End: frames no longer overflow below the anchor box, and the column growth direction is no longer inverted, so test mode now matches live frames. (PR #113 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Switching between Party and Raid in the settings window while test mode is on now keeps test mode active and moves it to the selected mode, instead of turning it off. (PR #126 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix frame padding not applying consistently to test frames — the health bar inset now updates on every test frame like it does on live frames, instead of only on frames with reduced-max health. (PR #127 by Krathe)

## [4.3.11] - 2026-05-21

### Bug Fixes

* (Settings) Fix changes such as adding an auto layout not appearing in the settings window until a reload, caused by the page-caching change. (PR #106 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Fix the sidebar's expanded/collapsed categories not updating to match the new profile when switching profiles with the settings window open. (PR #107 by Krathe)

## [4.3.10]

### New Features

* Added DandersFrames to the Blizzard addon compartment — left-click opens settings, right-click toggles solo mode. Also correctly listed under Unit Frames in the addon list. (PR #97 by Krathe, suggested by JPEscher)
* (Click Casting) Added a "Disable only while flying" option to the Profiles panel. Disables click-casting only when airborne (including druid flight form), while keeping it active on ground mounts. Mutually exclusive with the existing "Disable while mounted/flying" option. (PR #96 by Krathe, suggested by JPEscher)
* (Colour Picker) Added a Default button to the DF colour picker that resets the colour to its configured default value. Also populates ElvUI's Default button on the native picker for DF settings. (PR #95 by Krathe)
* **Reduced Max Health bar** — a new sub-bar appears on the right edge of party and raid frames when a unit's maximum health has been temporarily reduced (e.g. by certain Mythic+ affixes or boss debuffs), showing exactly how much of the bar is locked out. Customise it under **Health Bar → Reduced Max Health**: enable/disable, choose a texture and colour, set a blend mode, and toggle whether the health bar visually shrinks to fit (Clip Health Bar) or the reduced section overlays it.

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Banner controls no longer overlap when the settings window is narrow. (PR #81 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fix keyboard binds occasionally firing your action bar spell instead of the click-cast spell while the cursor is still on the frame. The mouseover-state guard now requires both checks to agree the cursor has actually left before clearing bindings.
* (Class Power) Fix Size, Colors, Position, and Show for Roles section headers showing as floating labels when Class Power Pips is disabled. (PR #82 by Krathe)
* (Debuffs) Fix debuff icons remaining visible on frames after a unit dies. (PR #85 by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fix icon borders missing on one or more sides when Pixel Perfect is enabled. (PR #79 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix gradient snapping to full brightness after a unit goes out of range and back in range while they have a dispellable debuff. (PR #89 by Krathe)
* (Export Settings) Fix the "All" preset unchecking Pinned Frames, Aura Designer, and Auto Layouts. (PR #78 by Krathe)
* (Frame Movers) Fix the orange and blue frame mover outlines rendering above the settings GUI, not following the raid frames when clicking Edit on an Auto Layout, and the position panel X/Y values not refreshing on Auto Layout edit. (PR #93 by Krathe)
* (Global Fonts) Fix the Affected Elements list missing entries and being clipped. (PR #76 by Krathe)
* (Global Fonts) Fix the font dropdown showing the previous profile's font after switching profiles. (PR #77 by Krathe)
* (Leader / Assist Icon) Fix the leader and assist icons not appearing on frames straight away when someone is given assist or the group leader changes.
* (Missing Buff Indicators) Fix a missing buff icon staying on your own frame after entering a delve and rebuffing. (PR #99 by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff Indicators) Fix stale icons remaining on frames after leaving a group. (PR #75 by Krathe)
* (Name Text) Fix names occasionally not appearing on frames, most commonly after a wipe or a roster change.
* (Pinned Frames) Fix all settings showing as overridden by an Auto Layout when only one setting is actually overridden. (PR #91 by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Fix pinned frame position being lost when an Auto Layout is active and the layout rebuilds, or resetting when clicking Edit on an active Auto Layout. (PR #90 by Krathe)
* (Range Fading) Fix out-of-range members briefly flashing at full alpha when joining a group or when the roster reshuffles. (PR #84 by Krathe)
* (Reset Page) Fix Buffs and Debuffs Enable toggles not resetting, plus name truncation and the minimap button now refresh live after a profile reset. (PR #83 by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) Fix a 1-pixel gap appearing on one side when "Match Health Bar Width" is on with Pixel Perfect. (PR #80 by Krathe)
* (Search) Fix settings edited from search results not firing their setting-specific update for any widget type (checkboxes, sliders, dropdowns, colour pickers, toggle switches) — e.g. the minimap button toggle had no effect when used from search. (PR #98 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Reduce FPS loss when dragging or scrolling the settings window by caching each settings page after its first build. (PR #101 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix locking frames turning off test mode when it was already active. (PR #87 by Krathe)

## [4.3.9]

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar colour flashing between active and expiring colours when an aura is past its expiring threshold, and the flash persisting while out of range. (PR #74 by Krathe)

## [4.3.8] - 2026-05-12

### New Features

* **Reset Page button** — every settings page that has a Sync/Copy button now also has a red **Reset Page** button to the left of them. Clicking it resets only that page's settings on the current mode (Party or Raid) back to their built-in defaults, with a confirmation popup. Aura Designer and Click Casting have their own reset systems and are not part of this.
* **Sync / Copy / Reset trio added to Visibility, Group Labels, Pinned Frames, Integrations, and Global Fonts pages** — these pages were previously missing the Sync-with-Raid/Party and Copy-to-Raid/Party buttons; they now match the rest of the addon's settings pages.
* **Reset Page button added to the Aura Blacklist page** — clicking it clears all of your custom blacklist toggles, with a confirmation popup. Sync/Copy doesn't apply here since the blacklist is shared across both modes.

### Improvements

* Reset, Copy, and Sync confirmation popups now use the addon's themed popup style.
* (In-game Changelog) Renamed the "Back" button on the changelog overlay to "Close" for clarity. (PR #58 by Krathe)
* Removed the ElvUI compatibility popup. DandersFrames no longer relies on Blizzard's party/raid frames, so ElvUI disabling them is harmless.
* Info and warning banners across all settings pages now have consistent styling with tone-coloured icons (info, warning, caution). (PR #57 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Reworked sound indicator: Missing Trigger and Expire Alert can now be toggled independently, with separate loop intervals and a new Play Once option. (PR #54 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Tint mode for health bar indicators now updates live when switching from replace mode, without needing to toggle the aura. (PR #62 by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Arena/Solo Shuffle) Fix teammate frames not updating between rounds when FrameSort is active. (PR #50 by Krathe)
* (Arena/Solo Shuffle) Fix frame ordering changing between Solo Shuffle rounds when FrameSort is active. (PR #73 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix new indicators briefly appearing above the minimap until the strata setting was toggled. (PR #51 by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Fix auras not showing on pinned frames when the unit isn't on your main party or raid frames. (PR #52 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators not firing on the first aura application after joining a group or entering a new zone. (PR #53 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix sound expire alert not re-triggering after a buff is refreshed and decays again. (PR #54 by Krathe)
* (Targeted List) Fix self-target colour overlay covering the text, sticking on the wrong bar, and snapping off instead of fading. (PR #55 by Krathe)
* (Aura Filters) Info banner text now wraps correctly at narrow window widths instead of overflowing the banner. (PR #57 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar tint indicator showing the wrong colour on newly-joined party members out of combat. (PR #62 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar tint indicators not fading when out of range with element-specific OOR enabled. (PR #60 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix absorb shields being hidden behind the dispel gradient on live frames. (PR #65 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix overlay leaking onto live frames after adjusting settings while in test mode. (PR #66 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix the gradient opacity and intensity sliders not previewing live on group frames. (PR #65 by Krathe)
* (Personal Targeted Spells) Fix the move-mode highlight box not aligning with where icons actually appear. The saved position is now the visual centre of the icon block, with a one-time migration to preserve existing placements. (PR #69 by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) Fix wrong icon shown next to Skyfury in the Shaman buff blacklist. (PR #70 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix grouped pet container misalignment when anchored to the right of the party. Users with custom Offset X on the right anchor may need to retune the slider — positive now means "more gap", matching the left anchor. (PR #71 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix Lua error spam from pet name updates in delves and other instanced content. (PR #72 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix Global Defaults changes not applying to live frames without a /reload.
* (Aura Designer) Fix the Reset All Aura Configs button not clearing indicators from live frames until /reload.
* (Aura Designer) Fix Color Duration by Time not transitioning live as a buff ticks down on icon, square, and bar indicators.

## [4.3.7] - 2026-05-07

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix bar fill colour alpha having no effect. The alpha channel of the fill colour is now applied to bar indicators in live frames and updates immediately when changed in settings. (PR #49 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix several settings — fill colour, border, duration text, expiring colour, Colour Bar by Duration — not applying to live frames without a /reload. (PR #45 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix bar Colour by Duration and Expiring Colour Override resetting to grey on the second and subsequent casts of an aura. (PR #47 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar indicators briefly animating from empty when an aura is applied with Smooth Bars enabled. (PR #48 by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fix duration text "Color by Time Remaining" not updating once an aura is applied. The colour now transitions green → yellow → orange → red as the timer ticks down. The Duration Color and Color by Time Remaining settings have also moved into the Duration Text section where they belong. (PR #46 by Krathe)
* (AFK Icon) Fix AFK timer not incrementing in raids and Mythic+. The timer now ticks correctly in all group types. (PR #41 by Krathe)
* Removed the "Only Dispellable Debuffs" setting from the Debuffs page. The setting no longer affected our display since 12.0.5 and has been removed. (PR #42 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix raid frames jumping upward when group composition changes with Groups Grow From set to Center. Previously the visible frames could shoot off the top of the screen each time a player joined a new group, requiring a Groups Grow From toggle to recover.
* (Test Mode) Fix raid test mode showing the wrong layout when Players Grow From is set to End. Test mode now mirrors what live raid frames look like.
* (Raid Frames) Fix raid groups flipping position on every GUI click when Players Grow From and Groups Grow From are both set to End. The combined setting now produces a stable layout that matches between settings panel and live frames.
* (Auto Profiles) Fix raid test mode frames landing in the wrong place when entering or exiting an auto-layout override. Test mode now repositions correctly without needing to lock and unlock the frames.
* (Status Icons) Fix duplicate summon and resurrection icons appearing on party and raid frames. Only one set of icons now renders.
* (Raid Frames) Fix Group Display Order, My Group First, and group visibility checkboxes not updating live raid frames. Player frames now reposition immediately instead of needing a /reload.

## [4.3.6] - 2026-04-30

### Improvements

* (Click Casting) Improved mouseover detection on hovered unit frames after a Blizzard API fix.
* (Click Casting) The conflict popup for Clique and Clicked now also appears when switching to a click-cast profile that turns click casting on.
* (Boss Debuffs) Updated the info banner to clarify that boss debuffs trigger dispel overlays in Hybrid or Blizzard mode.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added an Inset slider for the Blizzard dispel overlay so the gradient can extend past or shrink inside the frame edges.
* (Boss Debuffs) Replaced separate Icon Width and Icon Height sliders with a single Icon Size slider. Existing settings carry over to the larger of your two old values.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added an Open Edit Mode button to the Blizzard Overlay settings so you can preview the Blizzard dispel overlay live.

### Bug Fixes

* (Pet Frames) Fix Lua error spam during boss pulls when a pet is in the group.
* (Status Icons) Fix Lua error spam when the Status Icon font outline is set to "None".
* (Update Notification) Fix "You aren't in a party." and "You aren't in a raid." chat spam in LFG dungeons, LFR, scenarios, and battlegrounds.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons sometimes staying invisible after a transient registration hiccup until you fully reload.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons not rendering at certain size combinations.
* (Boss Debuffs) Skip private aura registration on pet frames — pets can't receive boss debuffs.
* (Click Casting) Fix target click-cast bindings on DandersFrames hitting the /target name range limit.
* (Boss Debuffs) Surface Blizzard private aura API errors instead of silently swallowing them.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons sometimes rendering behind the unit frame after a re-register, even with frame level raised.
* (Aura Designer) Reduce GUI lag when opening Aura Designer with many configured effects.
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix dispel type icons not fading when a unit goes out of range with element-specific alpha enabled.

## [4.3.5] - 2026-04-26

### Improvements

* (Dispel Overlay) Added a Frame Strata dropdown and Frame Level slider to the Blizzard overlay settings. Raise them if the overlay gets hidden behind frame text on short/wide frames.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added a Frame Strata dropdown next to Frame Level. Default is now HIGH so private aura icons always render above frame text and borders, including for users with small icon sizes. Lower it via the dropdown if you preferred the old behaviour.

### Bug Fixes

* (Tooltips) Fix aura tooltips being overwritten by the unit tooltip when hovering buffs and debuffs

## [4.3.4] - 2026-04-24

### Changes

* (Dispel Overlay) DandersFrames-only mode users have been switched to Hybrid mode for this update — Hybrid covers boss debuffs that DandersFrames mode missed. You can switch back under Settings > Dispel Overlay > Overlay Source if you prefer.

### Bug Fixes

* (Buff Bar) Fix buff icons sometimes getting stuck on the bar until reload after a unit went out of range and back
* (Aura Designer) Fix tracked auras occasionally not being deduped from the buff bar after a unit returns from out of range
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Overlay now stays on the correct player when roster or sort changes move players between slots, including mid-combat
* (Range) Fix Lua error spam from range checks during timewalking dungeons
* (Update Notification) Fix remaining "You aren't in a party." chat spam in delves and follower dungeons
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix boss debuff icons occasionally rendering behind the unit frame on some group members
* (Tooltips) Fix buff/debuff tooltip flickering with the unit tooltip when hovering an aura icon after entering the frame body

## [4.3.3] - 2026-04-21

### New Features

* **Pinned Frames in Test Mode** — Test Mode now fills your enabled pinned sets with fake units so you can design the layout without being in a group. Boss sets show friendly-NPC test units (Fiery Treant, Charred Bramble, etc.); player-mode sets show party/raid test units. A new **Test Count** slider in the Pinned Frames settings chooses how many frames appear (1–8 boss, 1–10 player). Test frames are non-secure mock frames that look identical to live frames — your real pinned setup isn't touched. Raid test mode only shows raid-profile sets, party test mode only shows party-profile sets, and the other mode's frames are never affected.
* **Dispel Overlay redesign** — Private Aura Dispel Overlay settings have moved to the Dispel Overlay tab under a new **Overlay Source** dropdown with four modes:
    * **Hybrid** — DandersFrames for normal dispels, Blizzard for boss debuffs (recommended)
    * **DandersFrames** — full customisation, does not cover boss debuffs
    * **Blizzard** — covers both normal debuffs and boss debuffs, limited customisation
    * **Off** — disabled
    
    In Hybrid mode the two overlays no longer double up; DandersFrames handles normal dispels while Blizzard picks up boss debuffs only. "Show Overlay For" (Dispellable By Me / All Dispellable) is now a single unified setting shared by both overlays.

### Improvements

* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Frames no longer collapse upward when a boss dies — surviving frames hold their position, and new bosses fill the next free slot. Slot assignments reset when combat ends
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Overlay no longer covers the frame border, text, and icons
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Added an Alpha slider to dim the overlay
* (Dispel Overlay) Section headers now show tags indicating which dispel types each section covers under the current Overlay Source mode
* (Dispel Overlay) Reduced CPU overhead in Blizzard and Off modes during combat

### Changes

* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Removed the "Show Dispel Icons" toggle — the top-right icons cannot be hidden separately from the overlay, so the option had no effect

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix constant tooltip Lua error spam during raid encounters with secret auras
* (Range) Fix error spam when range fading is active
* (Update Notification) Fix "You aren't in a party." chat spam in NPC follower dungeons and delves
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Aura Designer indicators now apply correctly when a boss slot swaps to a new NPC mid-encounter
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Out-of-range fading now works on boss frames
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix health, power, name, absorb, heal prediction, and aura updates not applying reliably
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix Aura Designer indicators from a previous boss lingering on a slot after it's assigned to a new NPC
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Reduce race conditions where a boss frame intermittently fails to appear on spawn
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix health and Aura Designer indicators not updating when a boss slot silently swaps to a different NPC mid-encounter
* (Pinned Frames) Fix stale background, border, and label from the real pinned container showing behind test frames when Test Mode matches the current group mode
* (Pinned Frames) The set label now appears above test frames in all cases, including cross-mode previews (e.g. raid test mode while in a party)
* (Targeted List) Cast bar now snaps to full yellow on interrupt instead of continuing to fill

## [4.3.2] - 2026-04-21

### New Features

* **Friendly Boss NPC Frames** — Pinned frame sets now have a Frame Type setting. Switch a set to "Friendly Boss NPCs" to display healable friendly boss units (boss1–boss8) instead of group members. Useful for encounters where friendly adds need healing. All layout, positioning, click-casting, buffs, debuffs, Aura Designer indicators, and out-of-range fading work the same as player-mode pinned sets. Visible frames compact to the set's anchor so there are no empty slots when only some boss units are friendly — even as bosses appear and die during combat.
* **Update notification** — if another DandersFrames user in your group or guild is running a newer stable version, you'll see a one-time chat message on login. Can be disabled in General > Settings > Notifications.

### Improvements

* **Pinned Frames** — movers are now color-coded per mode (orange for raid, purple-blue for party) so it's obvious which mode's position you're editing
* **Pinned Frames** — opening a pinned-frames page for the inactive mode (e.g. Raid settings while you're solo or in a party) now shows a preview container for that mode's frames so you can reposition them without joining a group
* (Aura Filters) Added an Aura Blacklist pointer section with a link to the dedicated Aura Blacklist tab, making it easier to find spell-specific exclusions from the filters page

### Bug Fixes

* Fix DPS jumping order mid-dungeon when "Separate Melee & Ranged DPS" is enabled
* (Click-Casting) Fix "In Combat Only" and "Out of Combat Only" conditions being ignored for Target Unit and Open Menu bindings
* (Aura Designer) Fix beacon indicators being invisible if saved at an icon size smaller than the slider minimum
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators inside Layout Groups not being draggable
* (Aura Designer) Spec-specific spells (e.g. Earthshield) now appear correctly after switching specs without needing a reload
* (Auto Profiles) Fix brief flicker to party settings when exiting the auto-profile editor before the raid override re-applies
* (Status Text) Fix "Offline" / "AFK" text lingering on a frame after the player comes back online
* (Status Text) Add "DND" status text display (previously only AFK was shown)
* (Frames) Fix the Resurrected buff icon staying on a player's frame after they've come back to life
* (Frames) Fix the summon-pending icon staying on your frame after leaving the group
* (Auras) Raid frame aura icon borders are now pixel-perfect (were slightly blurry when raid frame scale differed from UIParent)
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix boss debuff icons overlapping instead of spacing correctly when tooltips are hidden and growth direction is left/up
* (Defensives) Fix defensive cooldown icons swapping slot positions / flickering when multiple cooldowns are active
* (Defensives) Fix the second defensive cooldown icon not fading when the player is out of range or out of phase
* (Pinned Frames) Dragging the mover while viewing the inactive mode's settings no longer silently saves the new position to the active mode's profile
* (Pinned Frames) The Enable, Lock Position, and Show Label checkboxes no longer mutate the active mode's container when toggled from the inactive mode's settings
* (Pinned Frames) Fix the second pinned-frames tab being unselectable when the two sets had different Frame Types — the tab now sticks across the page rebuild
* (Pinned Frames) Boss-mode preview container now uses a single-frame placeholder (matching live behaviour when no boss is visible) instead of a four-frame-wide box
* (Aura Designer) Sound alerts now pick up live edits without toggling the alert off and on
* (Test Mode) Correct Monkbrew test unit from Mistweaver (healer) to Brewmaster (tank)
* (Frames) Fix "No secure position handler!" red error spamming chat on login/reload when raid frames are disabled

### 12.0.5 Compatibility

* **Private Aura Dispel Overlay** — on 12.0.5+, a new Blizzard-rendered dispel overlay for private auras replaces the old frame border overlay. Controlled from Boss Debuffs settings with options for dispel filter, gradient direction, and dispel type icons.
* Fix private aura anchors for 12.0.5 API changes

### API

* **OnFramesSorted callback** — External addons can subscribe to `DandersFrames.RegisterCallback(self, "OnFramesSorted", ...)` to be notified whenever party, raid, or arena frames are reshuffled. Fires once per sortType per tick (coalesced) in both combat and non-combat — covers settings changes, roster updates, role swaps, spec detection, and Blizzard's internal ASSIGNEDROLE re-sorts. Callback receives `(event, sortType)` where sortType is `"party"`, `"raid"`, or `"arena"`. Safe to call `DandersFrames_GetFrameForUnit(unit)` from inside the handler.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-04-15

### New Features

* **Disable Party or Raid frames** — new toggles in General > Settings let you fully disable either frame system. Disabled frames never load, so they use no resources. Requires a reload; the popup can also toggle Blizzard's frames on or off for you in the same reload.
* **Custom font for the settings panel** — pick a font and outline in General > Settings > Appearance. Applies instantly, no reload.
* **Addon language override** — run the addon in a different language than your WoW client (per-character). Defaults to auto-detect.

### Improvements

* Reorganised General > Settings into Frame Modes, Blizzard Frames, Appearance, and Language sections
* Blizzard frame toggles renamed from "Hide" to "Disable" (they fully disable, not just hide) and now appear in both Party and Raid views
* "Hide Blizzard Player Frame" moved to Display > Visibility
* Fixed Cyrillic, Korean, and Chinese characters showing as squares in various places

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Holy Paladin: Holy Bulwark now triggers the same indicator as Sacred Weapon. A warning icon on the spell explains why the two can't be tracked separately.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (Auras) Force-disable Blizzard aura data source ahead of its removal in 12.0.5 — all users now use Direct API mode immediately
* (Auras) Prevent Blizzard aura source from persisting via profile imports — removed from export categories, forced to Direct on import and every login
* (Aura Filters) Add info banner clarifying that Aura Filters only affect Buff Bar and Debuff Bar, with clickable links to related pages
* (Aura Filters) Remove outdated Defensives and Dispel Detection info section
* (Aura Filters) Dispellable filter now uses a toggle switch (Dispellable By Me / All Dispellable) instead of two separate checkboxes
* (Aura Filters) Warning banner when "All Debuffs" is disabled, recommending healers keep it enabled
* (Aura Blacklist) Add notice explaining the blacklist is a curated Blizzard list
* (Aura Blacklist) Add warning icon next to Symbiotic Relationship noting caster-only blacklist limitation
* (Aura Blacklist) Increased warning and notice banner icon sizes for better visibility
* (Boss Debuffs) Add info banner noting Boss Debuffs cannot trigger Dispel Overlays

### New Features

* **Toggle Switch GUI element** — new reusable UI control for mutually exclusive A/B settings, with themed visuals and label highlighting
* **"New" tab badges** — gold "New" text appears on tabs and their parent category for new features, auto-hides once the tab is opened
* **Targeted List** — a new stacked cast-bar display that shows enemy casts targeting party members. Replaces the group-frame Targeted Spells icons that were broken by Blizzard's recent UnitIsUnit hotfix. Party-mode only, with draggable mover, test mode, four style presets, and full appearance controls including font, colors, icon, border, textures, arrow prefix/suffix, self-target color overlay, hide out-of-combat filter, cast-to-channel transitions, interrupted flash, and per-text-element positioning

### Bug Fixes

* (Tooltips) Add tooltip refresh ticker so third-party tooltip addons (e.g. RaiderIO) can respond to modifier key state changes while hovering unit frames
* (Tooltips) Add clean unit token resolver for tooltip SetUnit calls to work around Midnight 12.0 taint propagation from secure frame attributes
* (Absorb Bars) Fix absorb bars showing as floating bars when Attached or Attached+Overflow display mode is selected
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators sometimes showing wrong settings (wrong font size, icon size, bar colors) — Configure now runs mid-combat so indicators always get correct static settings immediately
* (Aura Designer) Fix duration text using default Blizzard font/size when the cooldown FontString hasn't been created yet at configure time
* (Personal Targeted Spells) Removed the white center-line overlays from the mover frame
* (Targeted Spells) Added `UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET` to the registered event list — some cancelled casts previously left dangling personal-display icons

## [4.2.9] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (GUI) Modernised all scroll bars across the addon to use the new slim pill-style thumb instead of the default Blizzard scroll bars

### Bug Fixes

* (Dispel Overlay) Fix "All Dispellable" mode not showing the dispel overlay when using the Blizzard aura data source

## [4.2.8] - 2026-04-08

### New Features

* (Profiler) Major rework of the function profiler with new tabs for per-event CPU cost and per-frame OnUpdate handlers
* (Profiler) New columns for peak calls per frame and per-call memory allocation
* (Profiler) Right-click "Print to Chat" now emits a Top 5 summary
* (Profiler) Function coverage expanded from ~30 to ~140 tracked methods

### Performance

* **Major raid performance pass** — total addon CPU down about **62%** and memory churn down about **93%** in a 20-player boss fight. Expect smoother frames during heavy AoE, big pulls, and dispel-heavy fights, especially on older hardware
* (Buff & Debuff Tracking) Rebuilt the core aura system so it does the work once instead of repeating the same scan 6–7 times per update. Around 99% of aura events now use the fast cached path in raid
* (Dispel Highlights) The colored outline around dispellable debuffs is now near-free — its CPU cost dropped by about 95%
* (Absorb Shields) Shield overlays update about twice as fast and no longer create throwaway data on every update
* (Animated Highlights) Marching-ants borders redraw at 30 FPS instead of 60 with no visible difference, cutting their CPU cost to about a third
* (Aura Designer) Custom indicators reuse a pool of entries instead of creating new ones every frame — noticeably lighter at raid scale
* (Aura Designer) Expiring border color animation no longer tears down and rebuilds the entire border on every tick
* (Frame Updates) Small efficiency win across every frame refresh from caching commonly used WoW APIs

### Bug Fixes

* (Profiler) Fix taint errors from the profiler incorrectly wrapping Blizzard's secure compact raid frame handlers. The profiler now only instruments DandersFrames-owned frames

### Technical Notes

For the curious — measured in a 5m 38s raid boss fight (493,901 calls profiled):

* **Total addon CPU:** ~114 ms/sec → ~43 ms/sec (**−62%**)
* **Memory churn (top sources):** ~12 MB/sec → < 1 MB/sec (**−93%**)
* **Aura cache hit rate:** 99.6% (36,204 of 36,360 events skip the full scan)
* **Dispel overlay CPU share:** 16.4% → 0.8% (**−95%**)
* **Absorb update per call:** ~111 µs / ~80 B → 38.4 µs / 0 B (**−65% CPU, zero allocation**)
* **Aura tracking:** Now uses the `UNIT_AURA updateInfo` payload with a shared `DF.AuraCache` keyed by aura instance ID. Both Aura Designer and Dispel overlay read from the same cache instead of re-querying `C_UnitAuras`
* **Aura Designer indicator entries** are pooled (max 64 reused), and instance keys are cached in a two-level lookup table
* **Dispel overlay** caches its layout state and short-circuits `ApplyOverlayLayout` when nothing relevant changed — same pattern was then applied to absorb shields
* **Update.lua** caches `UnitHealth`, `UnitPower`, `InCombatLockdown` and 9 other Unit\* APIs as file-scope locals to skip global lookups in the hot path

## [4.1.7] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fix Blizzard data source showing no debuffs — Blizzard moved aura data from frame arrays to container objects in the latest update, updated reader to use new Iterate API

* (Grouped Raids) Fix hidden groups sometimes showing frames when players join or are moved into them — hidden group headers are now fully neutralized (attributes cleared) so they can never claim or display units
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private auras showing on wrong players after sorting or roster changes — restore reanchor system with combat lockdown guards so anchors rebind to the correct unit token

* (Auras) Add issecretvalue local cache to Icons.lua and DebugAuras.lua

## [4.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### New Features

* **Frame Scale** — new slider in Layout settings to scale party and raid frames (0.5x–2.0x). Movers, snap-to-grid, and drag all work correctly at any scale. Scale is per-profile and applies to containers, movers, and test frames.
* (Pinned Frames) **Auto-Update by Role** — when auto-add role filters are active (tanks, healers, DPS), players whose role no longer matches are automatically removed. Manually added players and offline players are never auto-removed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Grouped Raids) Fix empty groups overlapping populated groups — empty groups were being positioned at their natural grid slot instead of being skipped, causing overlap when groups compact
* (Grouped Raids) Fix groups sometimes overlapping on roster change — position handler now re-fires on every roster update to stay in sync with WoW's internal child re-sorting
* (Flat Raids) Fix raid anchor moving when respeccing or dying — grouped-mode positioning was resizing the shared container when flat mode was active
* (Flat Raids) Fix frames overlapping with grouped headers when auto layout switches from grouped to flat mode
* (Pinned Frames) Fix frames drifting towards bottom-left when changing scale
* (Pinned Frames) Fix drag speed mismatch at non-1.0 scale — frames now track the cursor 1:1 at any scale

## [4.1.3] - 2026-03-17

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing + Expiring** — when both are enabled, the indicator stays hidden while the buff is active, appears during the expiring window, then shows with normal appearance once the buff drops off
* (Auras) **Growth Direction Control** — replaced the single growth dropdown with a three-part control (Orientation, Wrap, Direction) for clearer configuration
* (Aura Designer) **Sound Alerts** — per-indicator sound alerts that play when an aura appears, expires, or is missing. Supports all LibSharedMedia sounds, adjustable volume, loop/one-shot modes, and a global "Mute All Sound Alerts" toggle in the Aura Designer banner. Includes a searchable sound dropdown picker.
* (Sorting) **[Experimental] FrameSort Addon Integration** — added support for the FrameSort addon. When enabled in General > Sorting, FrameSort controls frame ordering for party, raid (flat and grouped), and arena frames. Requires the FrameSort addon to be installed separately.

### Bug Fixes

* (Raid Frames) **Major fix** for raid frames jumping/shifting position when players join, leave, or when loading into LFR/BGs — completely reworked the reposition pipeline to batch all updates into a single authoritative reposition, with a settling debounce for instance loading
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frames flickering between party and raid settings during group transitions
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frame positioning breaking after layout or roster changes
* (Position) Fixed mover handles for both party and raid staying visible after switching group type
* (Auto Layouts) Fixed several issues with switching between flat and grouped layouts — duplicate frames, hidden groups reappearing after combat, and layout not updating after mid-fight settings changes
* (Aura Designer) Fixed grouped layout preview not rendering correctly after the growth direction overhaul — indicators were stacking on top of each other instead of spreading out
* (Aura Designer) Fixed custom border indicators not showing on the frame preview
* (Aura Designer) Fixed indicators appearing on disabled pinned frames
* (Aura Designer) Fixed several Show When Missing visual issues — out-of-range alpha, transparent frames, stale duration text, pulsate animation not stopping, and indicators not appearing in test mode
* (Sound Alerts) Fixed sound engine not finding raid frames when using flat layout
* (Sound Alerts) Sound-only auras now correctly tracked for buff bar dedup
* (Sorting) Fixed secret string taint in cross-realm name caching

### Improvements

* (Debug Console) Added comprehensive debug logging across roster updates, header visibility, flat raid operations, frame positioning, and frame layout — helps diagnose frame issues in the field

## [4.1.2] - 2026-03-16

### New Features

* (Health Text) **Hide % Symbol** — new checkbox to remove the percent sign from health percentage text
* (Pinned Frames) **Growth direction anchoring** — Frame Growth and Column Growth now support Start, Center, and End options, controlling which edge stays fixed as frames are added (e.g. "Start" grows rightward/downward, "End" grows leftward/upward)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reset Position button** — resets a pinned frame set to the center of the screen if it gets lost off-screen

> **Note:** Pinned frame positions may have shifted slightly due to the new anchoring system. Use the Reset Position button or reposition frames if needed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fixed buff/debuff borders staying visible even when disabled — operator precedence bug caused the buff border check to fire regardless of aura type
* (Aura Designer) Fixed stack count text bleeding onto adjacent icons when auras reorder in a layout group
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed 2nd+ defensive bar icons always showing tooltip and ignoring tooltip settings, anchor position, and click-through configuration

* (Status Icons) Fixed leader icon not hiding in combat when "Hide in Combat" is enabled
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed error when OnDragStop fires without a matching OnDragStart on pinned frame movers

## [4.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Bug Fixes

* (Pinned Frames) Fixed aura designer indicators (borders, defensives, dispels) leaking onto disabled pinned frame sets
* (Aura Designer) Fixed border indicator pandemic state using the regular border alpha instead of the configured expiring alpha
* (Aura Designer) Declassified Beacon of Virtue as non-secret — spell ID 200025 is on Blizzard's whitelist and readable via standard API

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### New Features

* (Position) **Permanent Mover handle** — a small always-visible drag handle on frames for repositioning without unlocking, with customizable position, size, offset, colors, show-on-hover with fade animation, hide-in-combat option, and red combat indicator
* (Position) **Permanent Mover quick actions** — left-click, right-click, shift+left-click, and shift+right-click can be bound to 13 preset actions including open settings, quick switch profile/click-cast profile, cycle profiles, toggle test mode, unlock frames, toggle solo mode, ready check, pull timer, reset position, and reload UI
* (Position) **Permanent Mover attach to unit** — handle can be attached to the container, first visible unit, or last visible unit so it follows the group size
* (Position) **Hide drag overlay** checkbox in the unlock panel to hide the blue drag area while keeping frames draggable

* (Aura Designer) **Hide duration text above threshold** — duration text can be hidden when the remaining time is above a configurable seconds threshold (icon, square, and bar types)
* (Aura Designer) **Expiring threshold in seconds** — expiring indicators can now trigger based on remaining seconds as well as remaining percentage
* (Aura Designer) **Trigger operator (ANY / ALL)** — indicators with multiple trigger spells can now require all triggers to be active (AND mode) or just one (OR mode, default)
* (Aura Designer) **Duration priority (Highest / Lowest)** — expiring indicators on multi-trigger spells can track the highest or lowest remaining duration buff
* (Aura Designer) **Custom border mode** — border indicators can now use an independent overlay per aura, so multiple border indicators can be visible at the same time
* (Aura Designer) **Settings grouped in containers** — all indicator settings panels and global defaults are now organized with bordered section containers
* (Aura Designer) **Earthliving Weapon** added as a trackable Restoration Shaman aura
* (Aura Designer) **Sense Power** added as a trackable Augmentation Evoker secret aura
* (Aura Designer) **Ebon Might self-buff tracking** — Augmentation Evoker's caster self-buff (395296) is now tracked on the player via fingerprint disambiguation, with correct tooltip and buff bar dedup
* (Aura Designer) **Symbiotic Relationship linked aura system** — Restoration Druid's caster buff is detected on the player and mirrored as an indicator onto the target's frame, with OOC target resolution, tooltip-based fallback, recast detection, and buff bar dedup

### Bug Fixes

* (Position) Fixed nudge buttons causing the blue drag area to vanish
* (Auras) **Fixed taint errors from secret value comparisons** — duration hide, expiring indicators, and color curves now correctly pipe secret values through secret-aware APIs only

## [4.0.16] - 2026-03-11

### Bug Fixes

* (Click Casting) **Fixed binding tooltip vanishing when pressing modifier keys** — modifier format mismatch caused all bindings to be filtered out

* (Fading) **Fixed name and health text alpha resetting to 1.0** on zone change, combat res, vehicle exit, and test mode exit
* (Aura Designer) **Fixed secret auras not appearing immediately on cast in combat** — inline fingerprint matching eliminates race condition between detection and rendering
* (Aura Designer) Fixed Verdant Embrace tooltip incorrectly showing Upheaval

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Secret aura tracking** — tracks auras that WoW hides behind secret spell IDs using signature-based fingerprinting (credit to Harrek for the technique and aura data from Advanced Raid Frames)
* (Aura Blacklist) **Combat / out-of-combat controls** — per-spell checkboxes to blacklist auras only in combat, only out of combat, or both

## [4.0.10] - 2026-03-02

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed addon managers (Wago, CurseForge) constantly prompting for updates due to stale version in TOC file — version is now updated as part of every release
* Fixed Aura Designer tracking buffs from other players instead of only your own casts

### New Features

* **Auto layout Copy To** — duplicate an auto layout (with all overrides) to any content type section, including same-section copying for different size ranges
* **Only My Buffs filter** — new toggle in Direct API buff filters that restricts all buff filters to player-cast buffs only (enabled by default); removes the now-redundant My Buffs sub-filter

## [4.0.9] - 2026-03-02

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed imported and duplicated profiles resetting to Default on reload/relog due to per-character SavedVariable not being synced

### New Features

* **Direct API buff filters** — added Not Cancelable, Big Defensives, and External Defensives as toggleable filter options
* **Additive filter logic** — enabled filters now use OR logic so selecting multiple categories shows the union (e.g. Raid In Combat + Big Defensives shows both) instead of requiring auras to match all selected filters
* **Defensive icon scanning** — defensive icon now detects both Big Defensives and External Defensives (e.g. Pain Suppression, Blessing of Sacrifice)
* **Filter tooltips** — hover any filter checkbox to see a description of what that category includes
* **Defensive bar spacing** — icon spacing slider now supports negative values for overlapping icons
* **Updated filter defaults** — buff filters default to Raid In Combat + Big Defensives + External Defensives; debuff filters default to Raid Debuffs + Crowd Control + Important Spells (migrated for existing users)

## [4.0.8] - 2026-03-01

### New: Aura Designer

Visual indicator system for tracking buffs, debuffs, and auras on your frames.
* **8 indicator types** — 3 placed indicators (Icon, Square, Bar) that occupy anchor points on the frame, plus 5 frame effects (Border, Health Bar Color, Name Text Color, Health Text Color, Frame Alpha) that affect the entire frame
* **Drag-to-place** — drag auras from the spell list onto any of 9 anchor points (corners, edges, center) with X/Y offset adjustment
* **Icon indicators** — spell icon with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count display
* **Square indicators** — colored square with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count
* **Bar indicators** — progress bar showing remaining duration with horizontal/vertical orientation, match-frame-width option, fill color, background color, and bar-color-by-time gradient
* **Border frame effect** — 5 styles: Solid, Animated, Dashed, Glow, and Corners Only with configurable thickness and color
* **Health Bar Color frame effect** — Replace or Tint mode with adjustable blend strength
* **Name/Health Text Color frame effects** — override unit name or health text color when an aura is active
* **Frame Alpha frame effect** — adjust entire frame transparency based on aura presence
* **Expiring system** — all 8 indicator types support an expiring color that activates below a configurable remaining-duration threshold, fully combat-safe
* **Priority stacking** — configurable priority per aura (1-20); frame effects only show the highest-priority active aura, placed indicators coexist on separate anchors
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can display alongside Aura Designer indicators, with a popup to choose when enabling AD
* **Global defaults** — configure default icon size, scale, duration/stack font, font scale, and outline style; new indicators inherit these automatically with per-indicator overrides available
* **Live preview** — indicators render on the frame preview in the options panel with adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×)
* **Per-spec aura lists** — curated aura lists for 8 healer and augmentation specs, auto-refreshes when switching specs

### New: Auto Layouts (Raid Only)

Automatically switches your raid frame layout based on content type and raid size. Does not apply to party, solo, or arena.
* **Three content categories** — Instanced/PvP (raids, dungeons, battlegrounds), Mythic (fixed 20-player), and Open World (world bosses, outdoor groups)
* **Per-size-range profiles** — create multiple layouts per content type, each covering a custom player range (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-40). Mythic is a single fixed layout for 20 players
* **Automatic switching** — monitors group roster, zone changes, and instance type; applies the matching layout on-the-fly when content or raid size changes
* **Override-only storage** — each layout stores only the settings that differ from your global profile; everything else is inherited automatically
* **Full settings coverage** — overrides can include frame size, growth direction, groups per row, group visibility, bar colors, text settings, aura filters, icon toggles, pinned frame configuration, and more
* **Live editing** — click "Edit Settings" to enter editing mode with live frame preview; every change is tracked as an override with visual indicators showing which settings are modified vs global
* **Override indicators** — green checkmark for global values, orange star with reset button for modified values, per-tab override counts
* **Non-destructive** — your global profile is never modified; exiting editing mode restores your base settings cleanly
* **Crash recovery** — if editing is interrupted, the next login detects and restores your base settings
* **Status display** — shows current content type, instance name, raid size, active layout, and override count
* **Export/import support** — auto layout configurations included in profile exports

### New: Aura System Improvements

* **Direct Aura mode** — optional mode that gives full control over which buffs and debuffs appear using filter categories (Player, Raid, Big Defensive, etc.). Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — master toggles to quickly show all buffs or all debuffs without configuring individual filters
* **Important Spells filter** — checkbox to show Blizzard's curated list of important buffs and debuffs
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8

### New Features

* Health fade system — fades frames above a configurable health threshold, with option to cancel fade when a dispellable debuff is active (contributed by X-Steeve)
* Class power pips — Holy Power, Chi, Combo Points, etc. displayed on the player frame as colored pips with configurable size, position, anchor, color, vertical layout, and role filter options (contributed by X-Steeve)
