-- — the record form normalizeFilters accepts; each record becomes one container
-- group behind the single visual debuff row.
--
-- Dedup at build time (token ownership order: dispel > cc > raid): a group's
-- filterString appends "|!TOKEN" for every enabled token-backed filter with
-- higher priority than itself; the boolean-backed groups (bossrole, priority)
-- negate ALL enabled token filters. Dispellable in "ALL" mode has no token —
-- it dedups by merging excludeDispelTypes into every OTHER record instead
-- (same ownership outcome: the dispel group owns the overlap). "ANY" mode is
-- token-backed (PTR-5 DISPELLABLE) and dedups like PLAYER via "|!DISPELLABLE"
-- negations; without the token it degrades to the ALL map form. A record never
-- negates its own token. Priority×Boss/Role overlap is accepted (bools can't

-- the set of categories owned by enabled Aura Designer debuff groups

-- dispellable). A claimed category's RECORD is dropped from the row, but its
-- negation / exclude-dispel contributions to the OTHER records are KEPT — the
-- AD group displays those auras, so the row must keep excluding them
-- everywhere. Dispellable claims are mode-agnostic (a group claiming
-- dispellable in either mode drops the row's dispel record whatever the row's
-- own mode is — simplest rule). Boss/role narrow independently: claiming only
-- boss while the row shows boss+role narrows the record to isRoleAura.
-- (A narrowed record keeps the accepted Priority×Boss/Role bool overlap above —
-- narrowing only shrinks the record's own flag, it never adds new negations.)
-- Show All short-circuits BEFORE claims — an ALL-mode row never consults them.
-- When claims empty a NON-empty selection the return is an EMPTY array (render
-- nothing) — distinct from nil (show all); normalizeFilters would map {} back
-- to show-all, so DriveDebuffFactory intercepts the empty list and parks the
-- row instead of building a container from it.

-- ============================================================
-- COLOUR-BY-TIME MODES (12.1 colour curve, build 68914+)
-- ============================================================
-- 68914 restored options.textColor on SetDurationText — it now forwards
-- SetTextColorCurve(curve, PROPERTY); the 68569 wrapper dropped the property arg, which
-- is the whole reason the curve was dead and colour shipped as |c escapes baked into the
-- formatter's bands. With the curve reachable, duration TEXT gets two independent dials:
--
--   INTERPOLATION  Linear = blends between stops · Step = snaps to the stop at or below
--   SCALE          seconds remaining · percent of total remaining
--
-- Probe-verified on 68914 (/al smoothcolor, readback in the lab log):
--   * Linear interpolates linearly in RGB and CLAMPS at both ends (below the first stop
--     and above the last) — it never falls to zero/black outside the authored range.
--   * Step FLOORS: x=2.5 yields the x=0 colour, x=7.5 the x=5 colour. That is exactly
--     DF's own "highest threshold <= remaining wins" rule, so STEP_SECONDS reproduces the
--     legacy bucket look with no compensation (no doubled points at band ends).
--   * RemainingPercent is expressed 0-100 (probe row G), matching the stops as stored.
--   * The curve writes the FONTSTRING's vertex colour, which inline |T textures IGNORE
--     (they keep their own baked vertex args). The expiry border/tint reveal is a |T
--     escape, so it can never blend — it stays stepped, and seconds-only because a static
--     formatter cannot know an aura's total duration. That asymmetry is a hard engine
--     ceiling, not a policy choice.
--   * |c escapes still beat the curve, so the legacy bucket path and a curve must never
--     both be armed on one fontstring (see the mutual exclusion in the row builders).

--   STATIC  -> one band, |T tinted to `staticColor`.
--   BYTIME  -> one band per BORDER-ramp step below the threshold, each |T tinted to that
--              breakpoint's colour. Breakpoints sig keys the cache (and the factory struct
--              key) so a Colours-page edit rebuilds the bind-frozen formatter.
-- The reveal reads the SAME account-wide ramp as the duration text, picked by `unit`
-- ("SECONDS" | "PERCENT" — the indicator's own expiryAlertThresholdUnit). One set of
-- colours for "time is running out"; the reveal simply cannot BLEND between them (the |T
-- escapes ignore the fontstring vertex colour a colour curve writes), so it steps where
-- text may blend.
-- UNIT: these bands and the reveal threshold are ONE formatter sampled against ONE
-- property, so `unit` governs both — which ramp is read AND the unit `threshold` arrives
-- in. On PERCENT the caller must bind this formatter to RemainingPercent
-- (Features/Expiration.lua feeds it through textFormat); binding it the default way
-- would judge percent bands against remaining seconds.
-- Cached under an "XBEL|" prefix (duration-text keys start with the format name, never "X").

-- ⚠ STACKS FORMATTERS ARE FORBIDDEN on container rows — do not re-add one.
-- (Removed 2026-07-09; was the alpha.2 in-combat container freeze.) Blizzard's
-- ApplyApplicationCount calls formatter:FormatNumber(applications) in LUA with the
-- stack count, which is SECRET in combat; formatter userdata cannot hold secrets, so
-- the call throws inside the container's dirty pass → the dirty-flag latch bricks the
-- container for the session. Bind-time validation can't catch it (AssertValidFormatter
-- test-drives with a non-secret value). The native no-formatter path (shows counts > 1,
-- rendered secure-side via secretwrap) is the only secret-safe option — `stackMinimum`
-- other than 2 is therefore not expressible on 12.1 container rows. Duration-text
-- formatters are NOT affected (C-side DurationTextBinding handles secrets).

-- (Removed 2026-07-09: GetDurationColorCurve. The smooth duration-text colour curve is
-- NOT addon-reachable on 68569 — SetDurationText{textColorCurve} drops the required
-- `property` arg, and the button's DurationTextBinding is PRIVATE, so "apply it on the
-- binding" cannot work; poking Blizzard-owned binding state on a live button is also the
-- exact touch class behind the combat dirty-latch freeze. durationColorByTime ships as
-- discrete colour BUCKETS via the duration formatter (|cRRGGBB escapes in AddBreakpoint
-- format strings — C-side, secret-safe, the NSRT-proven path): BuildDurationFormatter above.)

-- Colour-mode ramps. A StatusBar CROPS its fill texture to the filled fraction, so a

-- native fill drains: colour-by-remaining with ZERO reads, which is the only way to do
-- it in 12.1 (remaining time is secret). Two hard constraints, both probe-confirmed
-- 2026-07-20 (see the 12.1 lockdown notes + DF_AuraLab "Duration bar" verdicts):
--   * it keys off FRACTION remaining, never seconds — so it CANNOT mirror the
--     seconds-based durationColorByTimeBreakpoints thresholds, only their palette;
--   * the ramps are baked images and deliberately NOT driven by the colour pickers.
--     The fill crop clips only the statusbar's own texture (children are untouched),
--     and GetValue() returns a SECRET number, so neither a segmented ramp nor a
--     self-tinted one is possible. Don't re-litigate this without a new probe.
-- One orientation per curve. The ramp is painted for the DRAIN case: red at the left
-- end, green at the right, so the tip walks green -> red as the bar empties. That is
-- the only case there is - the bar always drains (see `direction` below), and Reverse
-- Fill needs NO mirrored art [confirmed in-game 2026-07-20]: the StatusBar flips the
-- texture along with the fill, so the ramp's relationship to the tip already survives.
-- VERTICAL bars need no second file either: SetRotatesTexture turns the same art.
-- Because they key off fraction, the two DF ramps are baked from the PERCENT scale's
-- DEFAULTS (DEFAULT_PERCENT_BREAKPOINTS above): f75555 at 0%, ff9838 at 25%, ffd23d at
-- 50%, 5fe05f at 75%, flat green above. The smooth ramp blends between those stops; the
-- stepped one floors to them, so the bar shows the same four hard bands the stepped
-- duration text does. Both are generated by Tools/generate_curves.py — re-run it if the
-- percent defaults ever move. The art carries the DEFAULTS, not the user's edited stops,
-- since a baked image cannot follow the pickers. Stored keys are frozen: DF has always
-- meant the smooth ramp, so existing profiles keep exactly the look they had.
-- The files are named *_Curve on purpose. Bare DF_* names belong to the LibSharedMedia
-- STATUSBAR textures registered in Config.lua — DF_Smooth is one of them, a bar texture
-- a user can pick — so a ramp must never be given one of those file names.

-- Row-claim dedup (C1): the filter records are built with the Aura Designer's
-- claimed-category set (DF:GetClaimedDebuffCategories — nil when AD is off /
-- doesn't own AD / has no debuff groups), so categories an enabled AD debuff
-- group displays are dropped from the row. Claims fold into the row signature
-- for free — they change the RECORDS, and filterStructSig serializes the records
-- — so a claim/unclaim (which rides an auraLayoutVersion bump from the AD GUI's
-- structural refresh) re-enters the version gate below and rebuilds.
--
-- EMPTY-LIST PARK: claims can empty a non-empty selection (every selected
-- category claimed). normalizeFilters maps an EMPTY filter list back to
-- "HELPFUL" (show all), so an emptied row must never reach the container —
-- park instead: hide the plain anchor frame (combat-safe, no backend op) and
-- stamp dfDebuffFactoryEmptyVer so steady-state drives return without
-- rebuilding records. The next version bump re-evaluates the claims.
-- Merge the debuff blacklist (db.debuffBlacklist) into the debuff row's filter
-- records as excludeSpellIDs. ROW-ONLY (never the AD debuff-group facade). A nil
-- filterList (show-all) becomes one HARMFUL record carrying just the exclude; an
-- empty array (fully claimed) is left parked. Called in DriveDebuffFactory BEFORE
-- the row signature is taken, so a blacklist toggle moves cfSig and re-tunes the
-- row (cfSig now serializes excludeSpellIDs). No-op when nothing is blacklisted.

-- ============================================================
-- MISSING-BUFF FACTORY BRIDGE — read-free layout-push inversion (probe 32,
-- live-confirmed 2026-07-10). One "missing"-mode handle per tracked raid buff:
-- an empty spellID-filtered group parks the badge inside a clip window; the
-- buff's (blank) button pushes it out. ZERO aura reads — works in combat on
-- every assistable unit, independent of the transitional whitelist. Replaces
-- the legacy UnitHasBuff 4-method scan on 12.1.
-- Behaviour change vs legacy (flagged in the port plan §2.5): manual multi-buff
-- mode shows EVERY tracked-and-missing buff as a strip of badges — the old
-- "first missing only" priority pick was a cross-aura read, which is dead.
-- Class-detection mode (one buff) is identical to legacy.

-- /df debug attached and /df debug mousefoci.
