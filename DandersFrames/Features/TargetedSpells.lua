-- ⚰ DEPRECATED-TARGETED-SPELLS — GROUP HALF REMOVED FROM THIS FILE 2026-07-29
-- ############################################################
-- Grep DEPRECATED-TARGETED-SPELLS to find every site. THIS comment is the
-- canonical one; the others are signposts back to here.
--
-- ☠ THREE THINGS THIS CHECKLIST GOT WRONG — it was written as a plan and never
-- checked against the code. Following it literally breaks LIVE features:
--   1. `activeCasters` is NOT group state. It is the shared "which enemies are
--      casting" registry: HandleTargetChange gates the PERSONAL display on it,
--      and the history interrupt marking reads its startTime. It STAYS.
--   2. `RegisterTargetedSpellEvents` is NOT group code — it registers the event
--      frame that Personal AND the Targeted List both run on. It STAYS.
--   3. `DF:UpdateTargetedSpellEventRegistration` is shared infrastructure, called
--      by the personal toggle, the list toggle and InitTargetedSpells. It STAYS.
-- The general trap: a function whose body names no personal/list symbol can still
-- be infrastructure both depend on. Symbol counting cannot see that — read the
-- callers. Everything else below held up.
--
-- DONE in this file: the icons, pool, layout, PositionIcons, Show/Hide/HideAll,
-- ShowInterruptedVisual, the whole roster-fingerprint resolver, GetFrameForUnit,
-- ShouldShow(Raid)TargetedSpells, Enable/Disable/ToggleTargetedSpells, the
-- write-only DF.targetedSpellsEnabled flag, and the group branches inside
-- ProcessCastInternal / HandleCastStop / OnEvent / NeedsCastEvents.
--
-- WHAT WENT: the GROUP-FRAME (on-frame) targeted-spell icons — the Indicators >
-- Targeted Spells page, and the icon pool / cast tracking / roster-fingerprint
-- machinery that fed them. Saved `targetedSpell*` keys were deliberately left on
-- existing profiles (see the note at the end of this block).
--
-- WHAT IS NOT: the PERSONAL display (`personalTargetedSpell*`, Indicators >
-- Personal Targeted) and the Targeted List. Both are live, both are supported,
-- and BOTH SHARE THIS FILE — the personal path compares against "player", which
-- is in UnitIsUnit's always-allowed list, so Blizzard's change never touched it.
-- ⚠ Do not delete this file. Deleting the feature means deleting the group half
-- OUT of it.
--
-- WHY: Blizzard's 2026-04-07 UnitIsUnit hotfix (detailed in the API
-- COMPATIBILITY block below) removed the only way to answer "is this enemy
-- casting at THIS group member". The feature has been force-disabled
-- unconditionally at load ever since — every setting on its page configured
-- something that could not render.
--
-- STATUS: the page was pulled from the sidebar 2026-07-27, and the group code was
-- DELETED 2026-07-29/30. This is no longer reversible by flipping a flag — the API
-- never came back across the remaining PTR builds. Restoring the feature means
-- restoring it from history, and it would still need an answer to UnitIsUnit.
--
-- The checklist below is kept as a RECORD, not a plan: it is what the removal
-- worked from, and the four places it was wrong are listed at the top of this
-- block. Read those before trusting any similar list.
--
-- DELETION CHECKLIST — what the removal covered:
--   Features\TargetedSpells.lua   the group half of this file: activeCasters,
--                                 the icon pool, PositionIcons,
--                                 Show/HideTargetedSpellIcon, the roster
--                                 fingerprint resolver, the cast/roster event
--                                 handlers, the setup wizard.
--                                 ⚠ NOT a contiguous block — the personal
--                                 helpers (ShouldShowPersonalTargetedSpells,
--                                 GetPersonalDB, the Show/Hide/Update Personal*
--                                 functions) are interleaved with them, and the
--                                 unit/content-type helpers near the top are
--                                 shared by both. Cut by function, not by range.

-- TARGETED SPELLS SYSTEM
-- Shows incoming spell casts targeting party/raid members
-- 
-- When an enemy casts a spell targeting a party member, this
-- displays an icon with cast bar on that member's frame to
-- warn healers of incoming damage.
--
-- Supports multiple simultaneous incoming spells with stacking.
-- Features:
--   - Highlight important spells (C_Spell.IsSpellImportant)
--   - Sort by cast time (newest/oldest first)
--   - Max icons limit
--   - Interrupted visual feedback
--   - Off-screen nameplate support

local activeCasters = {}

-- ============================================================
-- API COMPATIBILITY: Group-frame targeted spells (PERMANENTLY DISABLED)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Blizzard hotfixed UnitIsUnit on 2026-04-07 so that comparing a
-- compound token like "nameplateXtarget" against a party/raid
-- token now returns nil. That kills our per-frame "is this enemy
-- targeting THIS party member" detection.
--
-- There is no in-addon workaround:
--   * UnitGUID/UnitName on nameplate units become secret in
--     instance combat, so we can't compare those either.
--   * The new PlayerIsSpellTarget API only answers for the player,
--     not for arbitrary group members.
--
-- The change is now live on retail. Group-frame Targeted Spells is
-- force-disabled unconditionally at addon load. The personal-display
-- path (compares against "player") still works and is unaffected,
-- since "player" is in the always-allowed list of UnitIsUnit args.
--
-- A "Targeted List" feature is being designed as a replacement for
-- the per-frame icon use case (see _Reference/targeted-list-mockup.html).
-- ============================================================

-- (Removed) DF.GroupTargetedSpellsAPIBlocked and
-- DF.GroupTargetedSpellsAPIBlockedParty. Both were write-only: their last reader
-- was the Options page that went with the group display.
--
-- (Removed) ForceDisableGroupTargetedSpellSettings, which wrote
-- DF.db.raid.targetedSpellEnabled = false on every Init so "the GUI reflects the
-- disabled state". There is no GUI left to reflect it and the key has ZERO readers
-- addon-wide, so this was worse than dead: it CREATED a key nothing reads in every
-- raid profile, on every login. Removing a write is not covered by the
-- change-the-baseline rule — that rule preserves user data, and this manufactured
-- data no user set.

-- raidTestMode counts as raid: a raid PREVIEW is not a real raid, so IsInRaid() is

-- 2026-07-30. Hence the checkbox on the Targeted List / Personal Targeted pages;
-- see DF:SetNameplateOffscreen. Accepting target/softenemy as a fallback would
-- need GUID-based dedup instead of token-string dedup, which is a bigger change.

-- an enemy outside your view gets NO nameplate at all, so there is no
-- nameplateN unit token — and IsValidCasterUnit accepts nameplate tokens only.
-- A mob casting behind you is invisible to both features until you turn to face
-- it, even when you have it targeted and can see the cast on its frame.

-- TARGETED LIST
-- ============================================================
-- Stacked cast-bar display showing enemy casts targeting party
-- members. Anchored to the party frame container. Replaces the
-- group-frame Targeted Spells icons that Blizzard's 2026-04-07
-- UnitIsUnit hotfix permanently broke.
--
-- Party-mode only by design. We will not add raid support.
--
-- Implementation is split across commits:
--   * commit #3 (this one): scaffold — state tables, frame pool,
--     roster name cache, event hookup, empty lifecycle stubs
--   * commit #4: cast lifecycle (0.2s delay + all 13 gotchas from
--     the TS3 cross-reference in _Reference/targeted-spells-findings.md)
--   * commit #5: render pipeline + layout (bar build, LayoutBars,
--     Dispel-style skip-rebuild in the apply path)
--   * commit #6: settings sub-tab in Options.lua
--
-- The user-facing name "Targeted List" is intentionally decoupled
-- from the internal `targetedList*` db prefix. Renaming the feature
-- is a locale-only change; no code touches the string.
-- ============================================================

-- File-scope cached APIs (project convention, commit 1a5603d).
-- These are used by the cast lifecycle and render pipeline in later
-- commits; caching them here keeps the hot path zero-lookup.

-- Returns true if the caster's current cast target is a party member.
--
-- Why this shape: the "name-matching" approach the findings doc
-- originally proposed is dead because UnitSpellTargetName returns a
-- secret-tainted string on nameplates — it can't be used as a table
-- key or compared to anything. Instead we use TS3's filter
-- (Driver.lua:317): UnitInParty("nameplateXtarget"). This is a
-- compound-vs-party-token comparison that the findings doc warned
-- might be blocked by the 2026-04-07 hotfix. Empirically (and per
-- TS3's working implementation) it is NOT blocked — it returns a
-- usable boolean for this specific shape.
--
-- We don't return WHICH party member is targeted — we don't need to.
-- The render pipeline (commit #5) will fetch the target name via
-- UnitSpellTargetName and feed it directly into a FontString:SetText
-- secret-safe sink, which doesn't require comparing or indexing.
-- Returns ok, reason (see TargetedList_IsActive for why).
--
-- ⚠ The last check is the one to distrust if bars go missing in a group. The comment
-- block above claims UnitInParty on a compound token is "empirically NOT blocked" by
-- the 2026-04-07 hotfix. That is an ASSERTION, not something we have measured on this
-- build. If 12.1 did seal it, this returns false for every real party target and the
-- only bars you'd ever see are untargeted casts — which looks exactly like "the list
-- misses a lot". The trace below distinguishes the two cases.

--
-- ⚠ THE NAMEPLATE REQUIREMENT IS THE FEATURE'S HARD CEILING. Only `nameplateN`

-- matter what it casts. That makes the list sensitive to the nameplate CVars —

-- behind you or off-screen never appear), nameplateMaxDistance — and to WoW's own

--
-- The mitigation here mirrors TS3's approach (Driver.lua lines
-- 391-407):
--   * Don't extract time fields from Unit{Casting,Channel}Info — only
--     pull spellId (and castID for casts) via positional discard.
--   * Get spellId from the EVENT payload when possible — it's clean.
--   * Use UnitCastingDuration / UnitChannelDuration for duration.
