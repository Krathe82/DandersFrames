# DandersFrames Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Interface Overhaul

A top-to-bottom rework of the configuration UI so every panel shares one consistent look and behaviour.

* (Interface) **One shared widget toolkit** — buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, sliders, range sliders, text inputs, colour pickers, tooltips, info banners, tab strips and panel/section backdrops are now built from a single themed set of helpers instead of dozens of hand-rolled one-offs, so every control looks and behaves identically across the addon (consistent accent colour, hover and disabled states). (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Disabled settings grey out in place, addon-wide** — when a feature is turned off its options stay visible but dimmed and inactive (a consistent preview) instead of staying clickable or disappearing. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer / Text Designer) **Unified look** — both designers now share the same panel layout, preview frame, tab strip and column styling as the rest of the UI, so they no longer feel like separate tools. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reworked to match the standard UI** — the tab/sub-tab strip, designer-preset bar and grouped settings boxes now use the shared styling. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) **Page rebuilt** — restructured into grouped section boxes (Add / Saved / Received / Marker / Name Precedence) consistent with the other feature pages. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Consistent tabs, tooltips, banners & section boxes everywhere** — Options, Click Casting, Search, Auto Profiles, Test Mode and the icon library now share one tab style, one tooltip system, and the same info banners and settings-group boxes. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Material Symbol icons** normalised to a consistent size and padding, with new icons added. (by Krathe)
* (Interface) **Wording & value consistency** — standardised inconsistent labels and dropdown values across the settings UI; the Settings-panel font outline now offers its full option set. (by Krathe)
* (Localization) Wrapped the remaining hardcoded UI text so settings labels and Click Casting messages translate properly. (by Krathe)

### New Features

* (Highlights) New **Hide on Tanks** option — suppresses the aggro highlight on tanks so it only flags when a DPS/healer pulls. Off by default. (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Added an optional **power bar** for pet frames, with adjustable height and colour. Off by default. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned sets can now **anchor to your raid/party frames** instead of the screen, tracking them as they move or resize. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Auto Layouts) Moving raid frames while an auto layout is active now edits **that layout**, via its own Unlock button. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Each set's **Horizontal/Vertical Spacing** now inherits from the based-on mode, overridable per set. (by Krathe)
* (Options / Click Casting) Inline "Note:" labels are now consistent and no longer show a stray "?". (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) The binding **Priority** slider now reads left-to-right as High → Low and shows the priority number directly. The stored priority is unchanged — only the slider's display orientation changed. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Sorting) Fixed the combat-status banner on the Sorting page sometimes appearing as a blank white box instead of its coloured status. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) **Border Inset** is now honoured by texture-style borders, and updates live. (by Krathe)
* (Text) Fixed a stray health value (often a "%") appearing for users who never turned health text on. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) Fixed an error matching nicknames against boss/NPC names on pinned frames in encounters.
* (Localization) Test Mode, position, grid, Text/Aura Designer and auto-profile labels now translate properly.
* (Raid) Test mode now matches live raid frame positions in flat and grouped layouts, including Center alignment. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) Group labels no longer linger over the flat raid grid after switching from a grouped layout. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed click-through not applying to stacked defensives that appear mid-combat. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Health-bar **Tint** now fills the whole bar instead of leaving an edge gap under a border. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed aura **borders** showing the wrong colour/thickness on imported or older profiles. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed imported/older auras sometimes showing **no indicators** until re-saved. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The fill-**Bar** indicator's expiring **Tint** controls are now available in the editor. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed **Import Buffs Tab Defaults** not carrying the buff border toggle to new icon auras. (by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) **Smooth Bar Animation** now actually smooths the bar's fill. (by Krathe)
* (Buffs / Debuffs) Fixed pixel-perfect aura icons being mis-sized when a custom **Border Thickness** was set. (by Krathe)
* (Status Icons) The **Frame Level** slider now previews live while dragging. (by Krathe)
* (Profiles) The **Border Color Source** (Class/Role) for Missing Buff/Defensive icons is now kept on single-category export/import. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) A binding's **combat condition** now shows in the list immediately instead of after a reload. (by Krathe)
* (Debuffs) Removed the defunct **Highlight Dispellable** toggle (handled by Dispel Overlay). (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Pet **name and health text show again** (font/anchor/colour settings now apply). (by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) An empty party pet frame no longer lingers over the raid frames when a member summons a pet in a raid. (by Krathe)
* (Global Font) **Apply to All** now also restyles the Text Designer text (Name / Health / Status and custom elements); the Affected Elements list was updated to match. (by Krathe)
* (Raid) The frame **Unlock/Lock** toolbar button now updates its label correctly in raid mode (it previously stayed on "Unlock" after unlocking). (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) The Mythic layout's fixed-range badge no longer overflows its button. (by Krathe)
* (General) Fixed the doubled "v" in the version line printed on login. (by Krathe)

## [4.5.0]

### New Features

* (Targeted Spells) On-frame targeted spell icons are back for **party frames** — an icon appears on the party member an enemy is casting at, so you can spot incoming danger at a glance. Works in dungeons, arenas, and the open world; enable it under **Indicators → Targeted Spells**. Party members who share the same class, role, race, and sex can't be told apart and won't show an icon — you'll be warned by name when that happens. Technique credit to Ellesmere (EllesmereUI). Raid frames aren't supported.
* (Aura / Text Designer) New **Designer Presets** — save named presets of your Aura Designer and Text Designer setups and choose which one each mode uses. Each **Party / Raid** tab gains a **Preset** selector plus **New / Duplicate / Rename / Delete** (a non-deletable **Default** is always available), so you can build different setups — a focused tank layout vs a minimal one, say — and switch between them without rebuilding. Raid auto-layouts can point at their own preset, and editing a preset updates every consumer using it. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) You can now have **more than two pinned sets** — up to four, and **Party and Raid are independent** (e.g. four sets in raid, one in party). The set editor gains a **+ Add** button to create a new set and an **×** on the active tab to remove one (the last set can't be removed). A counter shows how many sets are defined and how many are currently active, since each enabled set is a live frame group. Use **Copy Pinned Frames** if you want both modes to match.
* (Pinned Frames) New per-set **Hide Auras** and **Hide Status Icons** toggles — strip the buff/debuff (and Aura Designer) display or the status icons from a pinned set for a clean, health-only highlight. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) New **Exclude Self** option per pinned set — keeps you out of that set's Auto-add (Tanks/Healers/DPS), handy for Augmentation Evoker and other buff-others playstyles. Works in groups and solo. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) New **Disable in PvP** toggle (on by default) — pinned frames stay dormant in arena and battlegrounds, where the constant unit churn could otherwise hurt performance. Turn it off to highlight teammates there. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Each pinned set can now choose its own **Aura Designer** and **Text Designer preset** — pick one in Frame Style, or leave it on **Inherit** to follow the mode's preset. Lets a highlighted set show a different aura/text layout from your normal frames. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames are now **independently customisable** per party/raid mode: a **Frame Style** section with a **Based on** selector (Party / Raid, defaulting to their own mode) sets the inherited look, and the settings that also exist on your main frames — **Width**, **Height** and **Scale** — inherit the chosen frames' value and can be overridden per set, each showing a star and a reset button, just like an auto-layout override. An **Override Border** toggle lets a set take its own border/glow (snapshotted from the chosen frames, then fully editable, with a one-click reset to re-inherit) to make highlighted players stand out. A party-only **Show in Solo Mode** toggle keeps them visible when you're not grouped. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Targeted Spells) Tuned the default look of the important-spell **Highlight** for both party and personal targeted spells — a thinner dashed border with a softer alpha, plus refreshed spacing/offset defaults. Only affects new profiles; existing setups are unchanged.
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames now **lock and unlock together with your main frames** — there's no separate per-set Lock Position toggle any more. Unlock your party or raid frames and the pinned sets for that mode show their drag handles too; lock again and they all settle. Each set's handle also opens the same **fine position panel** as the party/raid frames (precise X/Y nudge, centre, reset), so you can place a pinned set to the pixel. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frame settings are now **global per party/raid mode** and no longer saved into auto layouts — a raid auto layout only controls whether each pinned set is **shown** for that layout. This removes the stale/blank pinned data and editor mismatches that came from pinned settings being stored per-layout, and pinned edits now take effect live. (by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) The binding editor no longer shows the Advanced options section for Target Unit and Context Menu binds — those settings don't apply to those actions.
* Refreshed the DandersFrames addon icon.
* (Out of Range) The out-of-range text fade is now a single **Text Alpha** control that dims the whole Text Designer overlay together, replacing the old per-element Name/Health alpha sliders that no longer did anything once the Text Designer took over text rendering. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The party and personal targeted-spell icons now use the **full border toolkit** — style, colour, alpha, inset, blend mode, shadow and animation — the same controls as the rest of the addon, and the important-spell highlight is now its **own border** you can style separately. Existing highlight settings carry over. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Status Icons) The drop shadow shows again on the **AFK timer** and **all status-icon text**. A 12.0.7 font change stopped the old fontstring-level shadow from rendering, so status-icon and timer text lost their shadow while the rest of your text kept it; they now apply the shadow through the font itself like everything else. The global **Shadow X / Y / Color** sliders also preview live again while dragging — on live, pinned, and test frames — instead of only after a reload. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Animated borders (dashed / marching-ants and the other motion effects) no longer freeze after a frame hides and re-shows, or an aura icon is recycled from the pool — they kept their "already running" marker even though the underlying animation had stopped, so they sat static until a setting was nudged to force a restart. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Fixed pixel-perfect borders dropping a side, switching sides when an icon moved, or looking thicker than their set size. Icon/frame edges are now snapped to the physical pixel grid, so a 1px border lands cleanly on a single row of pixels instead of straddling two. Also fixes a small icon-to-border gap that showed on freshly-added Aura Designer indicators in the preview. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The on-frame targeted-spell duration timers now count down in Test Mode instead of sitting on a frozen value, so you can preview the look while configuring them. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed a Lua error that could spam in combat when an aura indicator used a **Gradient** border together with **Expiring Colour Override** — the expiring colour resolves through the aura's protected duration in combat, and the border's gradient-clear step rejected it. The border now recolours cleanly. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Text Designer elements now update on pinned frames right away when you add or edit them, instead of only showing up after toggling test mode.
* (Raid) **Group Display Order** and **My Group First** now reposition the frames live: changing the order (or toggling My Group First) moves the raid frames immediately instead of only moving the group labels and leaving the frames in default order until the next roster change. The **My Group First** setting also now saves when toggled while editing an active auto layout, instead of being lost on reload. (by Krathe)
* (Arena) Fixed teammates who load in late sometimes staying missing for the whole round, the frame order breaking after a mid-match reload, and frames staying hidden after a reload during a match. (by Krathe)
* (Range) The frame border (and other element borders) now reliably **fade out of range**, preserved across border re-renders. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) The missing-buff icon no longer flags a **cross-faction group member in the open world** as needing a buff you can't actually cast on them — it only appears where the buff is castable (e.g. inside instances). (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icon) The defensive cooldown icon and its border now render **above auras** and stay co-planar with the icon. (by Krathe)
* (Role Icons) **Show Tank / Healer / DPS** toggles now apply live without a `/reload`, and are properly decoupled from the Hide-in-Combat gate. (by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fixed missing frames for players who are still loading in, such as battleground backfills joining mid-match. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The **Name Text** and **Health Text** indicators (recolour the unit's name/health text on aura presence) work again now that the Text Designer owns that text — they recolour the Text Designer's name/health elements, including the expiring colour fade. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Filters) Removed the "Important Spells" buff and debuff filter, which Blizzard removed from the game.
* (Click Casting) Fixed Target Unit and the unit menu not working when bound to a keyboard key or an extra mouse button since the 12.0.7 patch — now fixed on DandersFrames, Blizzard's default unit frames, and other unit-frame addons. Technique credit to Ellesmere (EllesmereUI).
* (Buff/Debuff) **Show Buffs / Show Debuffs** toggles now apply live without a `/reload` — already-shown auras hide or reappear immediately instead of lingering until the unit's next aura change. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Pinned frames now reappear when you zone into a battleground or arena, instead of staying hidden until a `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Pinned & Raid Frames) Fixed frames cascading into a diagonal "staircase" when switching their grow direction between Horizontal and Vertical — the layout now re-flows cleanly without a `/reload`. Pinned layout changes (direction, spacing, size) made during combat are also applied when combat ends, instead of being dropped until the next change. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) A border set to thickness **0** now hides cleanly across every style, while any border animation keeps running. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Fixed a doubled glow that could appear on the **PROC** border animation when it re-triggered; the PROC start-flash is now an opt-in option. (by Krathe)
* (Personal Targeted Spells) The personal targeted-spell display now honours your **raid** and **party** settings separately — disabling it on the raid tab no longer leaves it showing in raid (the whole feature was reading the party settings, ignoring raid's enable / size / position / border). (by Krathe)

## [4.4.1]

### Bug Fixes

* (Text Designer) Fixed the Text Designer being left out of the 4.4.0 release, which left its settings page empty and could make frame text disappear. It is now included and working.

## [4.4.0]

### New Features

* **Text Designer** is now available in all versions (previously alpha-only) — add any number of custom text elements to your unit frames, each with its own font, size, colour (or class colour), anchor and position. Elements can show live data: identity (name, class, level, race, faction, group number, custom text), health, power, shields & heals, dead/offline status, threat and range. Find it under the **Text** tab.
* (Frames) **Unified border system** — every border (frame, buff/debuff icons, aura bars, defensive icons, missing-buff, resource bar, pet frames, targeted spells) now runs through one engine with consistent **Style / Colour / Alpha / Gradient** controls. (by Krathe)
* (Borders) Added optional **border animations** — 10 effects (pulse, wipe, ripple, segment reveal, sides/corners-only, proc glow, dash, and more), available wherever a border is drawn. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Status icons now use crisp **modern Blizzard atlas art** (ready check, summon, resurrect, phased, vehicle, main tank/assist, AFK), with automatic fallback to the legacy texture. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Each status-icon section header now shows a **live preview** — the icon swatch, or its status text when "Show as Text" is on. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) New **BG objective carrier icon** — lights up a friendly party/raid member carrying a battleground objective (flag or orb). (by Krathe)
* (Role Icon) **Custom role icons** — choose Blizzard, DF, or your own external texture per role (Tank / Healer / DPS). (by Krathe)
* (AFK Icon) Dedicated **Timer Text** controls for the elapsed-time counter (font, size, outline, colour, offset). (by Krathe)
* (Fonts) Bundled **Roboto Mono** (SemiBold/Bold) — a monospaced option for perfectly static countdown text. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) New **in-combat indicator** — a small crossed-swords icon lights up when a unit is in combat. Off by default, with its own position and size controls. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) Added `/df clearoverride <key|prefix|all>` to **remove a stuck per-layout override** the settings UI can't reach. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) New **Nicknames** feature — show custom names on your party and raid frames. Build a prioritised list from your friends, guild and group, or type names in by hand, and choose how matches are made. Optionally mark nicknamed players with brackets (or other styles) and share your own nickname with the group. Find it under **General → Nicknames**. (by Maelareth)
* (Nicknames) The **Add from** lists (friends, guild, group, Battle.net) put **online members first**, and you can **favourite** people with the star to pin them to the very top. (by Maelareth)
* (Resource Bar) Added a **Color Mode** (Power Type / Class / **Custom**) with a custom-colour picker, and a **Texture** dropdown so the resource bar can use any statusbar texture. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) New **Background Color** effect — colour a frame's background when an aura is active (Replace or Tint), with the same Expiring colour override, Pulsate and out-of-range handling as the other effects. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) The missing-buff border can now use **Class or Role colour** instead of a single fixed colour. (by Krathe)

### Improvements

* (Performance) The expiring-border ticker now **throttles and staggers per entry** to cut overhead when many borders are expiring at once. (by Krathe)
* (Defaults) Tuned some new-profile defaults — buff icon sizing/spacing, stack-count offsets, text outline shadows, and indicator border insets. (by Krathe)
* (Reduced Max Health) The bar's default colour is now a **translucent grey** instead of opaque black so it reads clearly on a dark health bar; profiles still on the old default are migrated automatically. (by Krathe)
* (Boss Debuffs) **Border Scale** can now go negative to hide the icon border. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Reorganised **every status-icon's settings into collapsible Settings / Appearance / Position boxes**, and changes now apply to live frames instantly — no `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Icons) Renamed **"Raid Target Icon" → "Target Marker Icon"**, with a header preview showing the four common markers. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) The separate **Status / Ready** and **Role / Leader** preview toggles are now a single **Icons** toggle, matching the live status-icon grouping. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) The **override tooltip and `/df overrides` now read clearly** — each changed setting shows as a breadcrumb path with its value, and the override counts agree everywhere. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Expiring health-bar highlights now **pulse in unison** across all frames instead of each frame pulsing on its own timing. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) The health-bar indicator's **Tint** mode has a new **Tint Entire Bar** option — tint the whole bar including the missing-health portion. (by Krathe)
* (Text) The built-in Name, Health, and Status text settings are now handled entirely by the **Text Designer** — the older text pages are hidden and your existing text is converted to Text Designer elements automatically. Customise all frame text under the **Text** tab.
* (Resource Bar) Added **Maelstrom** and **Pain** to the per-power resource colour options, so Shaman and Vengeance Demon Hunter resource bars can be recoloured. (by Krathe)
* Moved **Pixel-Perfect Scaling** to **General → Settings**, since it applies globally to both party and raid. (by Krathe)
* (Nicknames) **Northern Sky Raid Tools compatibility** — when NSRT is also set to put nicknames on DandersFrames frames, a one-time prompt lets you choose which addon decides the names shown on your frames (changeable later under **General → Nicknames → Name precedence**). (by Maelareth)
* (Aura Designer) Alert sounds now play on the **Master** channel by default, so they stay audible even with Sound Effects or Music muted; a new **Channel** dropdown lets you pick a different channel. (by Krathe)
* Ready for **patch 12.0.7** — the addon-compartment tooltip and the frame mover's Ready Check action keep working on the new patch. (by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Pinned Frames) Fixed a freeze ("script ran too long") when entering an arena or battleground; pinned frames now stay dormant in instanced PvP, with an option to re-enable them. (by Krathe)
* (Sorting) Group frames no longer **reshuffle mid-fight** when members share the same sort position, and hidden unit information during **Mythic+ encounters** no longer causes errors. (by Krathe)
* (Status Icons) Fixed an error from **AFK tracking** during Mythic+ encounters. (by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) The colour now updates correctly when your **power type changes** (for example, on shapeshift). (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) While in a raid you can now only edit the **active layout**, so editing no longer disturbs your live raid frames. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fixed frame-level effects sometimes **missing from the live preview**. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed icon positions **drifting** from where test mode shows them at non-default icon scales. (by Krathe)
* (Reduced Max Health) The reduced-max-health overlay now follows the **health bar's orientation**, including vertical bars. (by Krathe)
* (Range) Frame and element borders — including Aura Designer border effects — now reliably **fade out of range**. (by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff) No longer flags a **cross-faction group member in the open world** for a buff you can't cast on them. (by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icon) The defensive cooldown icon and its border now render **above auras**. (by Krathe)
* (Role Icons) **Show Tank / Healer / DPS** toggles now apply live without a `/reload`. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Indicators are torn down when the Aura Designer is disabled, and re-applied on **profile swap**. (by Krathe)
* (Targeted Spells) The targeted list no longer appears in **test mode** when the feature is disabled. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Replace-mode health-bar highlight fixes — no more **flicker** on phased or out-of-range units, no **bleeding over the frame border**, and the expiring **Pulsate** option now works. (by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Replaced several test-mode buff/debuff preview icons that pointed at art removed in Midnight, so they no longer render blank. (by Krathe)
* (Designers) The Aura/Text Designer preview now rebuilds to the **frame size of the auto layout being edited**, and edits keep applying to test-mode frames after **switching between auto layouts**. (by Krathe)
* (Frames) Bars referencing a **texture you don't have installed** now fall back to the bundled default with a one-time notice, instead of rendering black. (Requires WoW 12.0.7.) (by Krathe)

## [4.3.12]

### New Features

* (Heal Prediction) Added a "Show Heals From" option — All Incoming, My Heals, Others' Heals, or Split — letting you choose which incoming heals the bar shows. Split draws your heals and other healers' heals as separate coloured segments. (PR #109 by Krathe)
* Added a `/df attached` command that lists other addons attaching castbars, cooldowns or auras to your frames — handy for telling apart DF features from another addon's. (PR #104 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Added a **"Target unit when click-casting"** option — click-casting a spell on a frame can now also make that unit your target. Set it globally in the Click Casting profiles panel, or override it per-binding under Advanced → Macro Options. (PR #116 by Krathe)
* (Fonts) Expanded text styling across every font setting: added **Monochrome**, **Monochrome Outline**, and **Monochrome Thick Outline** outline styles; a drop **shadow can now be combined with any outline** (each font now has its own Shadow checkbox) instead of being mutually exclusive; and a new **Crisp Font Rendering (SDF)** option in Global Fonts smooths text edges for sharper text. (PR #115 by Krathe)
* (Frames) Added border customization under Frame → Appearance: a **Border Style** option (Solid or Texture), where the Texture style can use any border registered with SharedMedia (the built-in set, or ones added by other media addons), plus a **Border Size** slider to adjust thickness. (PR #119 by Krathe)
* (Frames) Added a **Use Class Color** option for the frame border, colouring each frame's border by the unit's class. (PR #120 by Krathe, suggested by maelareth)
* (Frames) Added bundled frame border textures — **DF Glow**, **DF Bevel**, **DF Inset**, and **DF Double** — selectable under the Texture border style (and shared with other media-aware addons). Designed with square corners for rectangular frames; the bevel/inset shade with the chosen border colour for a 3D edge. (PR #121 by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Absorbs) Fix the absorb / heal-absorb / heal-prediction bars leaving a sliver of the health bar showing when Reduced Max Health (Clip Health Bar) and a frame border were both enabled. The bars were inset by the border width even at the internal clip edge, where there is no border. (PR #124 by Krathe)
* (Absorbs) Fix the overflow absorb bar not fading out of range when using the Attached + Overflow absorb style. (by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) Replaced the unclear "OOC" toggle label with clear "Combat" and "Out of Combat" column headers. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) The class dropdown now uses the standard arrow instead of a stray yellow one. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix the colour picker's alpha not affecting the health bar indicator on live frames, and fix the Blend % slider reappearing in Replace mode after closing and reopening the GUI. (PR #102 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix the health bar indicator's expiring colour ignoring its own alpha — it reused the base colour's alpha instead. The expiring colour now uses its configured transparency, in both Tint and Replace modes. (PR #117 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Colour pickers now offer a Default button that resets to the configured default, matching the rest of the addon. (PR #103 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix a custom Replace-mode health bar colour flickering to full opacity on every health change. (by Krathe)
* (Auto Layouts) Fix editing a raid auto layout while not in a raid enabling the party Pinned Frames — the pinned-frame refresh targeted the live group's mode (party) instead of raid. (PR #125 by Krathe)
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private aura anchors remaining bound to the previous occupant of a unit slot after a roster change, causing icons to not appear on replacement players for the rest of the session. (PR #112 by Krathe)
* (Class Colors) The class colour list is now a single section instead of being split into two columns. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Renamed the "Cast on DOWN" option to "Cast on mouse down" and added a tooltip, clarifying that it only affects mouse clicks on frames (keyboard binds are unaffected). (PR #118 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Trinket and item keybinds now cast on mouseover, target, or self when those fallbacks are enabled — previously they always cast on your current target regardless of fallback settings.
* (Frame Movers) Fix the raid frames' unlock "Drag to move" text using a fixed fallback font instead of your Settings Font, so it now matches the party mover. (PR #122 by Krathe)
* (Heal Prediction) Fix the incoming-heal bar not keeping its size accurate as a unit's health changes while being healed. (PR #105 by Krathe)
* (Indicators) Renamed "Status Icon Text Settings" to "Icon Text Settings" for clarity. (PR #111 by Krathe)
* (Performance) Reduce the frame-rate hitch when joining a group: spec/talent update events fire in bursts as the client syncs data, and each one was triggering a full frame relayout. These are now coalesced into a single refresh. (PR #128 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix pet frames not attaching to the correct owner when custom sorting is enabled. (PR #108 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix pet frames reappearing after being turned off until a reload. (PR #108 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix grouped raid frames briefly jumping when interacting with the settings window: a redundant layout pass was re-firing the secure reposition even when nothing about the raid had changed. It now skips the reposition unless the sort order, group population, or layout actually changed. (PR #129 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix the Rows/Columns Grow From setting not always taking effect immediately when changed. (PR #134 by Krathe)
* (Range) Fix the frame border not fading out of range when Element-Specific Alpha is enabled — it was the only element the per-element fade didn't cover. Added a Border Alpha slider to control it. (PR #123 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Fix the Show Minimap Button and Hide Blizzard Player Frame toggles doing nothing when changed in Raid settings. They are now single global options on the Settings page, and the Visibility tab (whose options only apply to party/solo frames) is hidden in Raid mode. (PR #110 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Made the raid layout positioning options consistent between Group and Flat modes: Start/Center/End options are now labelled "Alignment", directional options use real directions (Left/Right or Top/Bottom), and these labels and their values now update live when you change the layout direction instead of needing the settings window reopened. (PR #114 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix grouped raid frames in vertical layout with Players Grow From set to End: frames no longer overflow below the anchor box, and the column growth direction is no longer inverted, so test mode now matches live frames. (PR #113 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Switching between Party and Raid in the settings window while test mode is on now keeps test mode active and moves it to the selected mode, instead of turning it off. (PR #126 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix frame padding not applying consistently to test frames — the health bar inset now updates on every test frame like it does on live frames, instead of only on frames with reduced-max health. (PR #127 by Krathe)

## [4.3.11] - 2026-05-21

### Bug Fixes

* (Settings) Fix changes such as adding an auto layout not appearing in the settings window until a reload, caused by the page-caching change. (PR #106 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Fix the sidebar's expanded/collapsed categories not updating to match the new profile when switching profiles with the settings window open. (PR #107 by Krathe)

## [4.3.10]

### New Features

* Added DandersFrames to the Blizzard addon compartment — left-click opens settings, right-click toggles solo mode. Also correctly listed under Unit Frames in the addon list. (PR #97 by Krathe, suggested by JPEscher)
* (Click Casting) Added a "Disable only while flying" option to the Profiles panel. Disables click-casting only when airborne (including druid flight form), while keeping it active on ground mounts. Mutually exclusive with the existing "Disable while mounted/flying" option. (PR #96 by Krathe, suggested by JPEscher)
* (Colour Picker) Added a Default button to the DF colour picker that resets the colour to its configured default value. Also populates ElvUI's Default button on the native picker for DF settings. (PR #95 by Krathe)
* **Reduced Max Health bar** — a new sub-bar appears on the right edge of party and raid frames when a unit's maximum health has been temporarily reduced (e.g. by certain Mythic+ affixes or boss debuffs), showing exactly how much of the bar is locked out. Customise it under **Health Bar → Reduced Max Health**: enable/disable, choose a texture and colour, set a blend mode, and toggle whether the health bar visually shrinks to fit (Clip Health Bar) or the reduced section overlays it.

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Banner controls no longer overlap when the settings window is narrow. (PR #81 by Krathe)
* (Click Casting) Fix keyboard binds occasionally firing your action bar spell instead of the click-cast spell while the cursor is still on the frame. The mouseover-state guard now requires both checks to agree the cursor has actually left before clearing bindings.
* (Class Power) Fix Size, Colors, Position, and Show for Roles section headers showing as floating labels when Class Power Pips is disabled. (PR #82 by Krathe)
* (Debuffs) Fix debuff icons remaining visible on frames after a unit dies. (PR #85 by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fix icon borders missing on one or more sides when Pixel Perfect is enabled. (PR #79 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix gradient snapping to full brightness after a unit goes out of range and back in range while they have a dispellable debuff. (PR #89 by Krathe)
* (Export Settings) Fix the "All" preset unchecking Pinned Frames, Aura Designer, and Auto Layouts. (PR #78 by Krathe)
* (Frame Movers) Fix the orange and blue frame mover outlines rendering above the settings GUI, not following the raid frames when clicking Edit on an Auto Layout, and the position panel X/Y values not refreshing on Auto Layout edit. (PR #93 by Krathe)
* (Global Fonts) Fix the Affected Elements list missing entries and being clipped. (PR #76 by Krathe)
* (Global Fonts) Fix the font dropdown showing the previous profile's font after switching profiles. (PR #77 by Krathe)
* (Leader / Assist Icon) Fix the leader and assist icons not appearing on frames straight away when someone is given assist or the group leader changes.
* (Missing Buff Indicators) Fix a missing buff icon staying on your own frame after entering a delve and rebuffing. (PR #99 by Krathe)
* (Missing Buff Indicators) Fix stale icons remaining on frames after leaving a group. (PR #75 by Krathe)
* (Name Text) Fix names occasionally not appearing on frames, most commonly after a wipe or a roster change.
* (Pinned Frames) Fix all settings showing as overridden by an Auto Layout when only one setting is actually overridden. (PR #91 by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Fix pinned frame position being lost when an Auto Layout is active and the layout rebuilds, or resetting when clicking Edit on an active Auto Layout. (PR #90 by Krathe)
* (Range Fading) Fix out-of-range members briefly flashing at full alpha when joining a group or when the roster reshuffles. (PR #84 by Krathe)
* (Reset Page) Fix Buffs and Debuffs Enable toggles not resetting, plus name truncation and the minimap button now refresh live after a profile reset. (PR #83 by Krathe)
* (Resource Bar) Fix a 1-pixel gap appearing on one side when "Match Health Bar Width" is on with Pixel Perfect. (PR #80 by Krathe)
* (Search) Fix settings edited from search results not firing their setting-specific update for any widget type (checkboxes, sliders, dropdowns, colour pickers, toggle switches) — e.g. the minimap button toggle had no effect when used from search. (PR #98 by Krathe)
* (Settings) Reduce FPS loss when dragging or scrolling the settings window by caching each settings page after its first build. (PR #101 by Krathe)
* (Test Mode) Fix locking frames turning off test mode when it was already active. (PR #87 by Krathe)

## [4.3.9]

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar colour flashing between active and expiring colours when an aura is past its expiring threshold, and the flash persisting while out of range. (PR #74 by Krathe)

## [4.3.8] - 2026-05-12

### New Features

* **Reset Page button** — every settings page that has a Sync/Copy button now also has a red **Reset Page** button to the left of them. Clicking it resets only that page's settings on the current mode (Party or Raid) back to their built-in defaults, with a confirmation popup. Aura Designer and Click Casting have their own reset systems and are not part of this.
* **Sync / Copy / Reset trio added to Visibility, Group Labels, Pinned Frames, Integrations, and Global Fonts pages** — these pages were previously missing the Sync-with-Raid/Party and Copy-to-Raid/Party buttons; they now match the rest of the addon's settings pages.
* **Reset Page button added to the Aura Blacklist page** — clicking it clears all of your custom blacklist toggles, with a confirmation popup. Sync/Copy doesn't apply here since the blacklist is shared across both modes.

### Improvements

* Reset, Copy, and Sync confirmation popups now use the addon's themed popup style.
* (In-game Changelog) Renamed the "Back" button on the changelog overlay to "Close" for clarity. (PR #58 by Krathe)
* Removed the ElvUI compatibility popup. DandersFrames no longer relies on Blizzard's party/raid frames, so ElvUI disabling them is harmless.
* Info and warning banners across all settings pages now have consistent styling with tone-coloured icons (info, warning, caution). (PR #57 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Reworked sound indicator: Missing Trigger and Expire Alert can now be toggled independently, with separate loop intervals and a new Play Once option. (PR #54 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Tint mode for health bar indicators now updates live when switching from replace mode, without needing to toggle the aura. (PR #62 by Krathe)

### Bug Fixes

* (Arena/Solo Shuffle) Fix teammate frames not updating between rounds when FrameSort is active. (PR #50 by Krathe)
* (Arena/Solo Shuffle) Fix frame ordering changing between Solo Shuffle rounds when FrameSort is active. (PR #73 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix new indicators briefly appearing above the minimap until the strata setting was toggled. (PR #51 by Krathe)
* (Pinned Frames) Fix auras not showing on pinned frames when the unit isn't on your main party or raid frames. (PR #52 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators not firing on the first aura application after joining a group or entering a new zone. (PR #53 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix sound expire alert not re-triggering after a buff is refreshed and decays again. (PR #54 by Krathe)
* (Targeted List) Fix self-target colour overlay covering the text, sticking on the wrong bar, and snapping off instead of fading. (PR #55 by Krathe)
* (Aura Filters) Info banner text now wraps correctly at narrow window widths instead of overflowing the banner. (PR #57 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar tint indicator showing the wrong colour on newly-joined party members out of combat. (PR #62 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar tint indicators not fading when out of range with element-specific OOR enabled. (PR #60 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix absorb shields being hidden behind the dispel gradient on live frames. (PR #65 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix overlay leaking onto live frames after adjusting settings while in test mode. (PR #66 by Krathe)
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix the gradient opacity and intensity sliders not previewing live on group frames. (PR #65 by Krathe)
* (Personal Targeted Spells) Fix the move-mode highlight box not aligning with where icons actually appear. The saved position is now the visual centre of the icon block, with a one-time migration to preserve existing placements. (PR #69 by Krathe)
* (Aura Blacklist) Fix wrong icon shown next to Skyfury in the Shaman buff blacklist. (PR #70 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix grouped pet container misalignment when anchored to the right of the party. Users with custom Offset X on the right anchor may need to retune the slider — positive now means "more gap", matching the left anchor. (PR #71 by Krathe)
* (Pet Frames) Fix Lua error spam from pet name updates in delves and other instanced content. (PR #72 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix Global Defaults changes not applying to live frames without a /reload.
* (Aura Designer) Fix the Reset All Aura Configs button not clearing indicators from live frames until /reload.
* (Aura Designer) Fix Color Duration by Time not transitioning live as a buff ticks down on icon, square, and bar indicators.

## [4.3.7] - 2026-05-07

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix bar fill colour alpha having no effect. The alpha channel of the fill colour is now applied to bar indicators in live frames and updates immediately when changed in settings. (PR #49 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix several settings — fill colour, border, duration text, expiring colour, Colour Bar by Duration — not applying to live frames without a /reload. (PR #45 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix bar Colour by Duration and Expiring Colour Override resetting to grey on the second and subsequent casts of an aura. (PR #47 by Krathe)
* (Aura Designer) Fix health bar indicators briefly animating from empty when an aura is applied with Smooth Bars enabled. (PR #48 by Krathe)
* (Defensive Icons) Fix duration text "Color by Time Remaining" not updating once an aura is applied. The colour now transitions green → yellow → orange → red as the timer ticks down. The Duration Color and Color by Time Remaining settings have also moved into the Duration Text section where they belong. (PR #46 by Krathe)
* (AFK Icon) Fix AFK timer not incrementing in raids and Mythic+. The timer now ticks correctly in all group types. (PR #41 by Krathe)
* Removed the "Only Dispellable Debuffs" setting from the Debuffs page. The setting no longer affected our display since 12.0.5 and has been removed. (PR #42 by Krathe)
* (Raid Frames) Fix raid frames jumping upward when group composition changes with Groups Grow From set to Center. Previously the visible frames could shoot off the top of the screen each time a player joined a new group, requiring a Groups Grow From toggle to recover.
* (Test Mode) Fix raid test mode showing the wrong layout when Players Grow From is set to End. Test mode now mirrors what live raid frames look like.
* (Raid Frames) Fix raid groups flipping position on every GUI click when Players Grow From and Groups Grow From are both set to End. The combined setting now produces a stable layout that matches between settings panel and live frames.
* (Auto Profiles) Fix raid test mode frames landing in the wrong place when entering or exiting an auto-layout override. Test mode now repositions correctly without needing to lock and unlock the frames.
* (Status Icons) Fix duplicate summon and resurrection icons appearing on party and raid frames. Only one set of icons now renders.
* (Raid Frames) Fix Group Display Order, My Group First, and group visibility checkboxes not updating live raid frames. Player frames now reposition immediately instead of needing a /reload.

## [4.3.6] - 2026-04-30

### Improvements

* (Click Casting) Improved mouseover detection on hovered unit frames after a Blizzard API fix.
* (Click Casting) The conflict popup for Clique and Clicked now also appears when switching to a click-cast profile that turns click casting on.
* (Boss Debuffs) Updated the info banner to clarify that boss debuffs trigger dispel overlays in Hybrid or Blizzard mode.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added an Inset slider for the Blizzard dispel overlay so the gradient can extend past or shrink inside the frame edges.
* (Boss Debuffs) Replaced separate Icon Width and Icon Height sliders with a single Icon Size slider. Existing settings carry over to the larger of your two old values.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added an Open Edit Mode button to the Blizzard Overlay settings so you can preview the Blizzard dispel overlay live.

### Bug Fixes

* (Pet Frames) Fix Lua error spam during boss pulls when a pet is in the group.
* (Status Icons) Fix Lua error spam when the Status Icon font outline is set to "None".
* (Update Notification) Fix "You aren't in a party." and "You aren't in a raid." chat spam in LFG dungeons, LFR, scenarios, and battlegrounds.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons sometimes staying invisible after a transient registration hiccup until you fully reload.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons not rendering at certain size combinations.
* (Boss Debuffs) Skip private aura registration on pet frames — pets can't receive boss debuffs.
* (Click Casting) Fix target click-cast bindings on DandersFrames hitting the /target name range limit.
* (Boss Debuffs) Surface Blizzard private aura API errors instead of silently swallowing them.
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix icons sometimes rendering behind the unit frame after a re-register, even with frame level raised.
* (Aura Designer) Reduce GUI lag when opening Aura Designer with many configured effects.
* (Dispel Overlay) Fix dispel type icons not fading when a unit goes out of range with element-specific alpha enabled.

## [4.3.5] - 2026-04-26

### Improvements

* (Dispel Overlay) Added a Frame Strata dropdown and Frame Level slider to the Blizzard overlay settings. Raise them if the overlay gets hidden behind frame text on short/wide frames.
* (Boss Debuffs) Added a Frame Strata dropdown next to Frame Level. Default is now HIGH so private aura icons always render above frame text and borders, including for users with small icon sizes. Lower it via the dropdown if you preferred the old behaviour.

### Bug Fixes

* (Tooltips) Fix aura tooltips being overwritten by the unit tooltip when hovering buffs and debuffs

## [4.3.4] - 2026-04-24

### Changes

* (Dispel Overlay) DandersFrames-only mode users have been switched to Hybrid mode for this update — Hybrid covers boss debuffs that DandersFrames mode missed. You can switch back under Settings > Dispel Overlay > Overlay Source if you prefer.

### Bug Fixes

* (Buff Bar) Fix buff icons sometimes getting stuck on the bar until reload after a unit went out of range and back
* (Aura Designer) Fix tracked auras occasionally not being deduped from the buff bar after a unit returns from out of range
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Overlay now stays on the correct player when roster or sort changes move players between slots, including mid-combat
* (Range) Fix Lua error spam from range checks during timewalking dungeons
* (Update Notification) Fix remaining "You aren't in a party." chat spam in delves and follower dungeons
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix boss debuff icons occasionally rendering behind the unit frame on some group members
* (Tooltips) Fix buff/debuff tooltip flickering with the unit tooltip when hovering an aura icon after entering the frame body

## [4.3.3] - 2026-04-21

### New Features

* **Pinned Frames in Test Mode** — Test Mode now fills your enabled pinned sets with fake units so you can design the layout without being in a group. Boss sets show friendly-NPC test units (Fiery Treant, Charred Bramble, etc.); player-mode sets show party/raid test units. A new **Test Count** slider in the Pinned Frames settings chooses how many frames appear (1–8 boss, 1–10 player). Test frames are non-secure mock frames that look identical to live frames — your real pinned setup isn't touched. Raid test mode only shows raid-profile sets, party test mode only shows party-profile sets, and the other mode's frames are never affected.
* **Dispel Overlay redesign** — Private Aura Dispel Overlay settings have moved to the Dispel Overlay tab under a new **Overlay Source** dropdown with four modes:
    * **Hybrid** — DandersFrames for normal dispels, Blizzard for boss debuffs (recommended)
    * **DandersFrames** — full customisation, does not cover boss debuffs
    * **Blizzard** — covers both normal debuffs and boss debuffs, limited customisation
    * **Off** — disabled
    
    In Hybrid mode the two overlays no longer double up; DandersFrames handles normal dispels while Blizzard picks up boss debuffs only. "Show Overlay For" (Dispellable By Me / All Dispellable) is now a single unified setting shared by both overlays.

### Improvements

* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Frames no longer collapse upward when a boss dies — surviving frames hold their position, and new bosses fill the next free slot. Slot assignments reset when combat ends
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Overlay no longer covers the frame border, text, and icons
* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Added an Alpha slider to dim the overlay
* (Dispel Overlay) Section headers now show tags indicating which dispel types each section covers under the current Overlay Source mode
* (Dispel Overlay) Reduced CPU overhead in Blizzard and Off modes during combat

### Changes

* (Private Aura Dispel Overlay) Removed the "Show Dispel Icons" toggle — the top-right icons cannot be hidden separately from the overlay, so the option had no effect

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Fix constant tooltip Lua error spam during raid encounters with secret auras
* (Range) Fix error spam when range fading is active
* (Update Notification) Fix "You aren't in a party." chat spam in NPC follower dungeons and delves
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Aura Designer indicators now apply correctly when a boss slot swaps to a new NPC mid-encounter
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Out-of-range fading now works on boss frames
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix health, power, name, absorb, heal prediction, and aura updates not applying reliably
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix Aura Designer indicators from a previous boss lingering on a slot after it's assigned to a new NPC
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Reduce race conditions where a boss frame intermittently fails to appear on spawn
* (Friendly Boss NPC Frames) Fix health and Aura Designer indicators not updating when a boss slot silently swaps to a different NPC mid-encounter
* (Pinned Frames) Fix stale background, border, and label from the real pinned container showing behind test frames when Test Mode matches the current group mode
* (Pinned Frames) The set label now appears above test frames in all cases, including cross-mode previews (e.g. raid test mode while in a party)
* (Targeted List) Cast bar now snaps to full yellow on interrupt instead of continuing to fill

## [4.3.2] - 2026-04-21

### New Features

* **Friendly Boss NPC Frames** — Pinned frame sets now have a Frame Type setting. Switch a set to "Friendly Boss NPCs" to display healable friendly boss units (boss1–boss8) instead of group members. Useful for encounters where friendly adds need healing. All layout, positioning, click-casting, buffs, debuffs, Aura Designer indicators, and out-of-range fading work the same as player-mode pinned sets. Visible frames compact to the set's anchor so there are no empty slots when only some boss units are friendly — even as bosses appear and die during combat.
* **Update notification** — if another DandersFrames user in your group or guild is running a newer stable version, you'll see a one-time chat message on login. Can be disabled in General > Settings > Notifications.

### Improvements

* **Pinned Frames** — movers are now color-coded per mode (orange for raid, purple-blue for party) so it's obvious which mode's position you're editing
* **Pinned Frames** — opening a pinned-frames page for the inactive mode (e.g. Raid settings while you're solo or in a party) now shows a preview container for that mode's frames so you can reposition them without joining a group
* (Aura Filters) Added an Aura Blacklist pointer section with a link to the dedicated Aura Blacklist tab, making it easier to find spell-specific exclusions from the filters page

### Bug Fixes

* Fix DPS jumping order mid-dungeon when "Separate Melee & Ranged DPS" is enabled
* (Click-Casting) Fix "In Combat Only" and "Out of Combat Only" conditions being ignored for Target Unit and Open Menu bindings
* (Aura Designer) Fix beacon indicators being invisible if saved at an icon size smaller than the slider minimum
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators inside Layout Groups not being draggable
* (Aura Designer) Spec-specific spells (e.g. Earthshield) now appear correctly after switching specs without needing a reload
* (Auto Profiles) Fix brief flicker to party settings when exiting the auto-profile editor before the raid override re-applies
* (Status Text) Fix "Offline" / "AFK" text lingering on a frame after the player comes back online
* (Status Text) Add "DND" status text display (previously only AFK was shown)
* (Frames) Fix the Resurrected buff icon staying on a player's frame after they've come back to life
* (Frames) Fix the summon-pending icon staying on your frame after leaving the group
* (Auras) Raid frame aura icon borders are now pixel-perfect (were slightly blurry when raid frame scale differed from UIParent)
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix boss debuff icons overlapping instead of spacing correctly when tooltips are hidden and growth direction is left/up
* (Defensives) Fix defensive cooldown icons swapping slot positions / flickering when multiple cooldowns are active
* (Defensives) Fix the second defensive cooldown icon not fading when the player is out of range or out of phase
* (Pinned Frames) Dragging the mover while viewing the inactive mode's settings no longer silently saves the new position to the active mode's profile
* (Pinned Frames) The Enable, Lock Position, and Show Label checkboxes no longer mutate the active mode's container when toggled from the inactive mode's settings
* (Pinned Frames) Fix the second pinned-frames tab being unselectable when the two sets had different Frame Types — the tab now sticks across the page rebuild
* (Pinned Frames) Boss-mode preview container now uses a single-frame placeholder (matching live behaviour when no boss is visible) instead of a four-frame-wide box
* (Aura Designer) Sound alerts now pick up live edits without toggling the alert off and on
* (Test Mode) Correct Monkbrew test unit from Mistweaver (healer) to Brewmaster (tank)
* (Frames) Fix "No secure position handler!" red error spamming chat on login/reload when raid frames are disabled

### 12.0.5 Compatibility

* **Private Aura Dispel Overlay** — on 12.0.5+, a new Blizzard-rendered dispel overlay for private auras replaces the old frame border overlay. Controlled from Boss Debuffs settings with options for dispel filter, gradient direction, and dispel type icons.
* Fix private aura anchors for 12.0.5 API changes

### API

* **OnFramesSorted callback** — External addons can subscribe to `DandersFrames.RegisterCallback(self, "OnFramesSorted", ...)` to be notified whenever party, raid, or arena frames are reshuffled. Fires once per sortType per tick (coalesced) in both combat and non-combat — covers settings changes, roster updates, role swaps, spec detection, and Blizzard's internal ASSIGNEDROLE re-sorts. Callback receives `(event, sortType)` where sortType is `"party"`, `"raid"`, or `"arena"`. Safe to call `DandersFrames_GetFrameForUnit(unit)` from inside the handler.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-04-15

### New Features

* **Disable Party or Raid frames** — new toggles in General > Settings let you fully disable either frame system. Disabled frames never load, so they use no resources. Requires a reload; the popup can also toggle Blizzard's frames on or off for you in the same reload.
* **Custom font for the settings panel** — pick a font and outline in General > Settings > Appearance. Applies instantly, no reload.
* **Addon language override** — run the addon in a different language than your WoW client (per-character). Defaults to auto-detect.

### Improvements

* Reorganised General > Settings into Frame Modes, Blizzard Frames, Appearance, and Language sections
* Blizzard frame toggles renamed from "Hide" to "Disable" (they fully disable, not just hide) and now appear in both Party and Raid views
* "Hide Blizzard Player Frame" moved to Display > Visibility
* Fixed Cyrillic, Korean, and Chinese characters showing as squares in various places

### Bug Fixes

* (Aura Designer) Holy Paladin: Holy Bulwark now triggers the same indicator as Sacred Weapon. A warning icon on the spell explains why the two can't be tracked separately.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (Auras) Force-disable Blizzard aura data source ahead of its removal in 12.0.5 — all users now use Direct API mode immediately
* (Auras) Prevent Blizzard aura source from persisting via profile imports — removed from export categories, forced to Direct on import and every login
* (Aura Filters) Add info banner clarifying that Aura Filters only affect Buff Bar and Debuff Bar, with clickable links to related pages
* (Aura Filters) Remove outdated Defensives and Dispel Detection info section
* (Aura Filters) Dispellable filter now uses a toggle switch (Dispellable By Me / All Dispellable) instead of two separate checkboxes
* (Aura Filters) Warning banner when "All Debuffs" is disabled, recommending healers keep it enabled
* (Aura Blacklist) Add notice explaining the blacklist is a curated Blizzard list
* (Aura Blacklist) Add warning icon next to Symbiotic Relationship noting caster-only blacklist limitation
* (Aura Blacklist) Increased warning and notice banner icon sizes for better visibility
* (Boss Debuffs) Add info banner noting Boss Debuffs cannot trigger Dispel Overlays

### New Features

* **Toggle Switch GUI element** — new reusable UI control for mutually exclusive A/B settings, with themed visuals and label highlighting
* **"New" tab badges** — gold "New" text appears on tabs and their parent category for new features, auto-hides once the tab is opened
* **Targeted List** — a new stacked cast-bar display that shows enemy casts targeting party members. Replaces the group-frame Targeted Spells icons that were broken by Blizzard's recent UnitIsUnit hotfix. Party-mode only, with draggable mover, test mode, four style presets, and full appearance controls including font, colors, icon, border, textures, arrow prefix/suffix, self-target color overlay, hide out-of-combat filter, cast-to-channel transitions, interrupted flash, and per-text-element positioning

### Bug Fixes

* (Tooltips) Add tooltip refresh ticker so third-party tooltip addons (e.g. RaiderIO) can respond to modifier key state changes while hovering unit frames
* (Tooltips) Add clean unit token resolver for tooltip SetUnit calls to work around Midnight 12.0 taint propagation from secure frame attributes
* (Absorb Bars) Fix absorb bars showing as floating bars when Attached or Attached+Overflow display mode is selected
* (Aura Designer) Fix indicators sometimes showing wrong settings (wrong font size, icon size, bar colors) — Configure now runs mid-combat so indicators always get correct static settings immediately
* (Aura Designer) Fix duration text using default Blizzard font/size when the cooldown FontString hasn't been created yet at configure time
* (Personal Targeted Spells) Removed the white center-line overlays from the mover frame
* (Targeted Spells) Added `UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET` to the registered event list — some cancelled casts previously left dangling personal-display icons

## [4.2.9] - 2026-04-10

### Improvements

* (GUI) Modernised all scroll bars across the addon to use the new slim pill-style thumb instead of the default Blizzard scroll bars

### Bug Fixes

* (Dispel Overlay) Fix "All Dispellable" mode not showing the dispel overlay when using the Blizzard aura data source

## [4.2.8] - 2026-04-08

### New Features

* (Profiler) Major rework of the function profiler with new tabs for per-event CPU cost and per-frame OnUpdate handlers
* (Profiler) New columns for peak calls per frame and per-call memory allocation
* (Profiler) Right-click "Print to Chat" now emits a Top 5 summary
* (Profiler) Function coverage expanded from ~30 to ~140 tracked methods

### Performance

* **Major raid performance pass** — total addon CPU down about **62%** and memory churn down about **93%** in a 20-player boss fight. Expect smoother frames during heavy AoE, big pulls, and dispel-heavy fights, especially on older hardware
* (Buff & Debuff Tracking) Rebuilt the core aura system so it does the work once instead of repeating the same scan 6–7 times per update. Around 99% of aura events now use the fast cached path in raid
* (Dispel Highlights) The colored outline around dispellable debuffs is now near-free — its CPU cost dropped by about 95%
* (Absorb Shields) Shield overlays update about twice as fast and no longer create throwaway data on every update
* (Animated Highlights) Marching-ants borders redraw at 30 FPS instead of 60 with no visible difference, cutting their CPU cost to about a third
* (Aura Designer) Custom indicators reuse a pool of entries instead of creating new ones every frame — noticeably lighter at raid scale
* (Aura Designer) Expiring border color animation no longer tears down and rebuilds the entire border on every tick
* (Frame Updates) Small efficiency win across every frame refresh from caching commonly used WoW APIs

### Bug Fixes

* (Profiler) Fix taint errors from the profiler incorrectly wrapping Blizzard's secure compact raid frame handlers. The profiler now only instruments DandersFrames-owned frames

### Technical Notes

For the curious — measured in a 5m 38s raid boss fight (493,901 calls profiled):

* **Total addon CPU:** ~114 ms/sec → ~43 ms/sec (**−62%**)
* **Memory churn (top sources):** ~12 MB/sec → < 1 MB/sec (**−93%**)
* **Aura cache hit rate:** 99.6% (36,204 of 36,360 events skip the full scan)
* **Dispel overlay CPU share:** 16.4% → 0.8% (**−95%**)
* **Absorb update per call:** ~111 µs / ~80 B → 38.4 µs / 0 B (**−65% CPU, zero allocation**)
* **Aura tracking:** Now uses the `UNIT_AURA updateInfo` payload with a shared `DF.AuraCache` keyed by aura instance ID. Both Aura Designer and Dispel overlay read from the same cache instead of re-querying `C_UnitAuras`
* **Aura Designer indicator entries** are pooled (max 64 reused), and instance keys are cached in a two-level lookup table
* **Dispel overlay** caches its layout state and short-circuits `ApplyOverlayLayout` when nothing relevant changed — same pattern was then applied to absorb shields
* **Update.lua** caches `UnitHealth`, `UnitPower`, `InCombatLockdown` and 9 other Unit\* APIs as file-scope locals to skip global lookups in the hot path

## [4.2.7] - 2026-04-07

### New Features

* (Auras) Added `Player Dispellable` and `All Dispellable` debuff filters to Direct API mode

### Improvements

* (Locales) Locale warnings now silent by default

### Performance

* (Auras) Reduced wasted aura processing in raid combat
* (Range) Reduced wasted range update events in busy zones

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fix "Compound unit tokens are not allowed" error spam in raid and arena
* (Internal) Removed two non-unit events from per-frame filter list

### Improvements

* (Debug Console) Redesigned page with collapsible sections and a wider log viewer
* (Defensive Icon) Now shows multiple big defensives at once and works consistently across both aura source modes

* (Auras) Auto-switch to Direct API mode if the upcoming WoW 12.0.5 patch removes the Blizzard aura source. A popup will explain the change if it triggers

### Bug Fixes

## [4.2.1] - 2026-04-04

* (Localization) Add full localization infrastructure using AceLocale-3.0 and CurseForge translation system — community translators can now contribute translations via the CurseForge web UI without touching code
* (Localization) Add locale stubs for 11 languages: English, German, Spanish (EU/LATAM), French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)

## [4.1.10] - 2026-03-31

## [4.1.6] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes

## [4.1.5] - 2026-03-24

### Bug Fixes

* (Grouped Raids) Fix hidden groups sometimes showing frames when players join or are moved into them — hidden group headers are now fully neutralized (attributes cleared) so they can never claim or display units
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private auras showing on wrong players after sorting or roster changes — restore reanchor system with combat lockdown guards so anchors rebind to the correct unit token

## [4.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### New Features

* (Pinned Frames) **Auto-Update by Role** — when auto-add role filters are active (tanks, healers, DPS), players whose role no longer matches are automatically removed. Manually added players and offline players are never auto-removed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Grouped Raids) Fix empty groups overlapping populated groups — empty groups were being positioned at their natural grid slot instead of being skipped, causing overlap when groups compact
* (Grouped Raids) Fix groups sometimes overlapping on roster change — position handler now re-fires on every roster update to stay in sync with WoW's internal child re-sorting
* (Flat Raids) Fix raid anchor moving when respeccing or dying — grouped-mode positioning was resizing the shared container when flat mode was active
* (Flat Raids) Fix frames overlapping with grouped headers when auto layout switches from grouped to flat mode
* (Pinned Frames) Fix frames drifting towards bottom-left when changing scale
* (Pinned Frames) Fix drag speed mismatch at non-1.0 scale — frames now track the cursor 1:1 at any scale

## [4.1.3] - 2026-03-17

* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing + Expiring** — when both are enabled, the indicator stays hidden while the buff is active, appears during the expiring window, then shows with normal appearance once the buff drops off
* (Auras) **Growth Direction Control** — replaced the single growth dropdown with a three-part control (Orientation, Wrap, Direction) for clearer configuration
* (Aura Designer) **Sound Alerts** — per-indicator sound alerts that play when an aura appears, expires, or is missing. Supports all LibSharedMedia sounds, adjustable volume, loop/one-shot modes, and a global "Mute All Sound Alerts" toggle in the Aura Designer banner. Includes a searchable sound dropdown picker.
* (Sorting) **[Experimental] FrameSort Addon Integration** — added support for the FrameSort addon. When enabled in General > Sorting, FrameSort controls frame ordering for party, raid (flat and grouped), and arena frames. Requires the FrameSort addon to be installed separately.

### Bug Fixes

* (Raid Frames) **Major fix** for raid frames jumping/shifting position when players join, leave, or when loading into LFR/BGs — completely reworked the reposition pipeline to batch all updates into a single authoritative reposition, with a settling debounce for instance loading

* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frame positioning breaking after layout or roster changes
* (Position) Fixed mover handles for both party and raid staying visible after switching group type
* (Auto Layouts) Fixed several issues with switching between flat and grouped layouts — duplicate frames, hidden groups reappearing after combat, and layout not updating after mid-fight settings changes

* (Aura Designer) Fixed custom border indicators not showing on the frame preview
* (Aura Designer) Fixed indicators appearing on disabled pinned frames

* (Sound Alerts) Sound-only auras now correctly tracked for buff bar dedup
* (Sorting) Fixed secret string taint in cross-realm name caching

### Improvements

* (Debug Console) Added comprehensive debug logging across roster updates, header visibility, flat raid operations, frame positioning, and frame layout — helps diagnose frame issues in the field

## [4.1.2] - 2026-03-16

### New Features

* (Health Text) **Hide % Symbol** — new checkbox to remove the percent sign from health percentage text
* (Pinned Frames) **Growth direction anchoring** — Frame Growth and Column Growth now support Start, Center, and End options, controlling which edge stays fixed as frames are added (e.g. "Start" grows rightward/downward, "End" grows leftward/upward)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reset Position button** — resets a pinned frame set to the center of the screen if it gets lost off-screen

> **Note:** Pinned frame positions may have shifted slightly due to the new anchoring system. Use the Reset Position button or reposition frames if needed.

### Bug Fixes

* (Auras) Fixed buff/debuff borders staying visible even when disabled — operator precedence bug caused the buff border check to fire regardless of aura type
* (Aura Designer) Fixed stack count text bleeding onto adjacent icons when auras reorder in a layout group
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed 2nd+ defensive bar icons always showing tooltip and ignoring tooltip settings, anchor position, and click-through configuration

* (Pinned Frames) Fixed aura designer indicators (borders, defensives, dispels) leaking onto disabled pinned frame sets
* (Aura Designer) Fixed border indicator pandemic state using the regular border alpha instead of the configured expiring alpha
* (Aura Designer) Declassified Beacon of Virtue as non-secret — spell ID 200025 is on Blizzard's whitelist and readable via standard API

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Trigger operator (ANY / ALL)** — indicators with multiple trigger spells can now require all triggers to be active (AND mode) or just one (OR mode, default)
* (Aura Designer) **Duration priority (Highest / Lowest)** — expiring indicators on multi-trigger spells can track the highest or lowest remaining duration buff
* (Aura Designer) **Custom border mode** — border indicators can now use an independent overlay per aura, so multiple border indicators can be visible at the same time

* (Aura Designer) **Earthliving Weapon** added as a trackable Restoration Shaman aura
* (Aura Designer) **Sense Power** added as a trackable Augmentation Evoker secret aura
* (Aura Designer) **Ebon Might self-buff tracking** — Augmentation Evoker's caster self-buff (395296) is now tracked on the player via fingerprint disambiguation, with correct tooltip and buff bar dedup

### New Features

* (Aura Designer) **Secret aura tracking** — tracks auras that WoW hides behind secret spell IDs using signature-based fingerprinting (credit to Harrek for the technique and aura data from Advanced Raid Frames)
* (Aura Blacklist) **Combat / out-of-combat controls** — per-spell checkboxes to blacklist auras only in combat, only out of combat, or both

* **8 indicator types** — 3 placed indicators (Icon, Square, Bar) that occupy anchor points on the frame, plus 5 frame effects (Border, Health Bar Color, Name Text Color, Health Text Color, Frame Alpha) that affect the entire frame
* **Drag-to-place** — drag auras from the spell list onto any of 9 anchor points (corners, edges, center) with X/Y offset adjustment
* **Icon indicators** — spell icon with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count display
* **Square indicators** — colored square with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count
* **Bar indicators** — progress bar showing remaining duration with horizontal/vertical orientation, match-frame-width option, fill color, background color, and bar-color-by-time gradient
* **Border frame effect** — 5 styles: Solid, Animated, Dashed, Glow, and Corners Only with configurable thickness and color
* **Health Bar Color frame effect** — Replace or Tint mode with adjustable blend strength
* **Name/Health Text Color frame effects** — override unit name or health text color when an aura is active
* **Frame Alpha frame effect** — adjust entire frame transparency based on aura presence
* **Expiring system** — all 8 indicator types support an expiring color that activates below a configurable remaining-duration threshold, fully combat-safe
* **Priority stacking** — configurable priority per aura (1-20); frame effects only show the highest-priority active aura, placed indicators coexist on separate anchors
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can display alongside Aura Designer indicators, with a popup to choose when enabling AD
* **Global defaults** — configure default icon size, scale, duration/stack font, font scale, and outline style; new indicators inherit these automatically with per-indicator overrides available
* **Live preview** — indicators render on the frame preview in the options panel with adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×)
* **Per-spec aura lists** — curated aura lists for 8 healer and augmentation specs, auto-refreshes when switching specs

### New: Auto Layouts (Raid Only)

Automatically switches your raid frame layout based on content type and raid size. Does not apply to party, solo, or arena.
* **Three content categories** — Instanced/PvP (raids, dungeons, battlegrounds), Mythic (fixed 20-player), and Open World (world bosses, outdoor groups)
* **Per-size-range profiles** — create multiple layouts per content type, each covering a custom player range (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-40). Mythic is a single fixed layout for 20 players
* **Automatic switching** — monitors group roster, zone changes, and instance type; applies the matching layout on-the-fly when content or raid size changes
* **Override-only storage** — each layout stores only the settings that differ from your global profile; everything else is inherited automatically
* **Full settings coverage** — overrides can include frame size, growth direction, groups per row, group visibility, bar colors, text settings, aura filters, icon toggles, pinned frame configuration, and more
* **Live editing** — click "Edit Settings" to enter editing mode with live frame preview; every change is tracked as an override with visual indicators showing which settings are modified vs global
* **Override indicators** — green checkmark for global values, orange star with reset button for modified values, per-tab override counts
* **Non-destructive** — your global profile is never modified; exiting editing mode restores your base settings cleanly
* **Crash recovery** — if editing is interrupted, the next login detects and restores your base settings
* **Status display** — shows current content type, instance name, raid size, active layout, and override count
* **Export/import support** — auto layout configurations included in profile exports

### New: Aura System Improvements

* **Direct Aura mode** — optional mode that gives full control over which buffs and debuffs appear using filter categories (Player, Raid, Big Defensive, etc.). Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — master toggles to quickly show all buffs or all debuffs without configuring individual filters
* **Important Spells filter** — checkbox to show Blizzard's curated list of important buffs and debuffs
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8

### New Features

* Health fade system — fades frames above a configurable health threshold, with option to cancel fade when a dispellable debuff is active (contributed by X-Steeve)
* Class power pips — Holy Power, Chi, Combo Points, etc. displayed on the player frame as colored pips with configurable size, position, anchor, color, vertical layout, and role filter options (contributed by X-Steeve)
